Type the message or open a text file containing it5. Launch the process6. Copy the decoding key in the clipboardNow, in order to your homie to read the glorious pun you just encoded, you have to send him the processed image alongside the decoding key. Keep in mind that the image MUST NOT be compressed in any way, otherwise the information will be lost! With default setting the image shouldn&apos;t be compressed by popular messaging application like Whastapp. But this isn&apos;t true anymore stepping up the resolution in the SETTING tab.This is what your bro has to do:1. Tap the DECODE tab2. Go to the INFO tab, read it, and then tap back again on DECODE3. Choose the received image containing the message4. Paste the key, without white spaces or other things5. Start the decode process6. The message will pop up below and will be possible to copy itIf you aren&apos;t color blind, you might enjoy encoding messages into color images, just enable the color mode in SETTING. Moreover will be possible to include three times the information than in black and white, but the computation time will be longer as well. This app origins from the assignment for the Multimedia Apps and Future Internet course of the University of Genoa, Electronic Engineering and Information Technology.The work is completely open source, you can find the source code following the link that is here somewhere or just look for OlimexSmart on GitHub.Special thanks to Claudio MArtino and Edoardo Lorenzetti.\n"},

It uses the f5 steganography algorithm, which employs matrix encoding to hide the picture, making it almost impossible to detect that any hidden communication is present.SonicVortex encryption is state-of-the-art AES/GCM encryption, suitable for banks and governments. So even in the highly unlikely event that any hidden communication becomes suspected, it is impossible for an adversary to ascertain the nature of the communication. Thus, your transaction is hidden and protected from even the most powerful adversaries.Additionally, AES/GCM protects against any changes to the encrypted, hidden transaction. If just one pixel of the picture is changed, the change will be detected and the transaction rejected.The latest version adds a Qr code reader as well as an address book.\n"},

Everything is done offline. PassLok stores nothing secret, not even in your device.This app is compatible with PassLok for Email (especially in Email mode), to be added shortly to the Chrome store. Use it if your email service is not yet supported by PassLok for Email.With PassLok, you can: - Write messages than only the intended recipient can read. - Do this without having established a secret password. - Lock files and images as easily as text.- Digitally sign text, images, and files so others can be sure they come from you. - Convert your favorite email or texting app into a secure communication channel. - Hide private information as apparently innocent text, or inside images. - Use Decoy mode, so your true message is not what it appears to be. - Create messages that can only be read once. - Communicate across platforms. - Send confidential mailings to several people at the same time. - Use a borrowed device, in case yours is bugged. - Be as paranoid as you like. We are really paranoid, and this is why we developed PassLok. PassLok uses 255-bit standard elliptic curves, which have been vetted against weaknesses by experts. On top of that, PassLok uses 256-bit XSalsa20 encryption and 512-bit hash functions to complete the locking process. XSalsa20 is a high-performance, open source cipher, which has been scrutinized by experts for nearly a decade without any practical weaknesses being found.The first time you run PassLok, it helps you to come up with a strong text-based secret Key, which can be whatever you want it to be. PassLok places no restrictions to make sure that you can always remember your Key without ever having to write it down. From your secret Key, PassLok creates a Lock, which is like a phone number that you give to the people you wish to send messages to you. They will \"put your Lock\" on those messages, and only your Key, which you have given to no one, will be able to unlock them. Optionally, you can post your Lock on the PassLok general directory, adding a video so people know the Lock is genuine. This is the Android version of PassLok, essentially identical to the versions released for PCs and mobile platforms. In addition, there is a pure html version of PassLok at the following mirrors: https://passlok.com/apphttps://www.autistici.org/passlok https://passlok.site44.com https://fruiz500.github.io/passlok If you want to check them out, you should get the source by doing ctrl-u or cmd-opt-u, get its checksum with an external program and compare it with the value at http://passlok.weebly.com.

The difference between an unencoded and encoded audio file is inaudible to the human ear, only complex steganalysis can determine whether the file has any data hidden in it. This method of data hiding is also resistant to transcoding between audio formats.\n"},

Angesichts dieser vielf\u00e4ltigen Gef\u00e4hrdungspotenziale kommt der Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (kurz: IT-Sicherheit) eine immer gr\u00f6\u00dfere Bedeutung zu. IT-Sicherheit ist allerdings kein Produkt, sondern ein sehr komplexer Prozess. Daf\u00fcr ist ein Sicherheitsmanagement erforderlich, das sowohl f\u00fcr den Aufbau einer technischen Infrastruktur (Firewalls, Intrusion-Detection-Systeme usw.) als auch f\u00fcr organisatorische Ma\u00dfnahmen (Security Policy, Auswahl von Sicherheitsma\u00dfnahmen usw.) zur Gew\u00e4hrleistung der IT-Sicherheit verantwortlich zeichnet.Dieser Kurs vermittelt in ausf\u00fchrlicher Form das Grundwissen zur IT-Sicherheit in vernetzten Unternehmen und Organisationen. Es stellt die wichtigsten Konzepte, Standards, Verfahren und Anwendungen vor und schafft damit die Wissensbasis f\u00fcr ein effektives, erfolgreiches Sicherheitsmanagement.Der Kurs richtet sich an IT-Mitarbeiter und IT-Manager, die sich in diesen Aufgabenbereich als zuk\u00fcnftige Sicherheitsmanager einarbeiten wollen; an Sicherheitsbeauftragte, die einen praxisorientierten \u00dcberblick \u00fcber alle wichtigen Prozesse des Sicherheitsmanagements such; an alle, die sich f\u00fcr das Sicherheitsmanagement von IT-Systemen interessieren.Was lernen Sie?Ziel des Kurses ist es, ein solides Verst\u00e4ndnis f\u00fcr die Prozesse der IT-Sicherheit zu entwickeln. Sie erwerben die notwendigen Kenntnisse, um im eigenen Unternehmen oder in der eigenen Organisation ein effektives Sicherheitsmanagement aufzubauen. Vorgestellt werden Konzepte und Standards f\u00fcr die Sicherheitsarchitektur sowie Verfahren und Anwendungen zum Schutz von IT-Systemen. Nach Bearbeitung des Kurses kennen Sie alle wichtigen Prozesse des IT-Sicherheitsmanagements und sind in der Lage, Wissen zu speziellen Fragestellungen selbstst\u00e4ndig zu vertiefen.In Kapitel 1 wird definiert, was unter IT-Sicherheit zu verstehen ist. Zur Einf\u00fchrung werden wichtige Bedrohungen der IT-Sicherheit identifiziert.Kapitel 2 beschreibt die wesentlichen Bestandteile von Sicherheitsarchitekturen, stellt die Rolle des Sicherheitsbeauftragten vor und beschreibt den Aufbau von Regelwerken f\u00fcr die Sicherheit.Kapitel 3 behandelt die wichtigsten Sicherheitsstandards aus der ISO-Familie sowie den BSI-Grundschutzkatalogen und stellt ihre Einsatzgebiete sowie ihre gegenseitige Abgrenzung dar.Kapitel 4 stellt Sicherheitsanalysen mit ihren Komponenten Bedrohungs-, Schwachstellen- und Risikoanalyse vor und f\u00fchrt diese Analysen beispielhaft durch.Kapitel 5 f\u00fchrt in zwei wesentliche Bedrohungskategorien der IT-Sicherheit ein: in das Social Engineering mit der Schwachstelle Faktor Mensch und in die allgegenw\u00e4rtige Gefahr der Infektion mit Schadsoftware.Kapitel 6 befasst sich mit geheimer Kommunikation und ihrer Grundlegung in Steganographie und Kryptographie. Kapitel 7 beschreibt die in Aufwand und Relevanz nicht zu untersch\u00e4tzenden Methoden der Schl\u00fcsselverwaltung f\u00fcr symmetrische und asymmetrische Verschl\u00fcsselungsverfahren.Kapitel 8 beschreibt die Methoden zur Erstellung und Pr\u00fcfung einer digitalen Signatur und stellt einige gebr\u00e4uchliche Formen digitaler Signaturen vor.Kapitel 9 gibt einen \u00dcberblick \u00fcber wichtige Sicherheitsma\u00dfnahmen und Konzepte f\u00fcr die Filterung des Datenverkehrs zwischen Netzen unterschiedlicher Sicherheitsniveaus. Stichworte sind hier: Intrusion Detection, Absicherung von E-Mails, zentrale Virenscanner, Penetrationstests, Quality Checks sowie die Verbesserung des Sicherheitsbewusstseins der Mitarbeiter (Awareness-Bildung).Kapitel 10 befasst sich ausf\u00fchrlich mit den Sicherheitsproblemen speziell des Mobile Computing.In Kapitel 11 erhalten Sie zusammenfassende Informationen (Aufgaben, Nutzungsm\u00f6glichkeiten) zu den Institutionen Trustcenter, CERT und BSI, die f\u00fcr die IT-Sicherheit von zentraler Bedeutung sind.\n"},

(This is called steganography - the practice of concealing messages or information within other non-secret text or data.)Anyone viewing the encrypted photograph will never ever know that it contains a &apos;secret message&apos; as it looks exactly like the original.The encrypted photo can then be sent to friends via email.Upon receiving the email with the attached encrypted photo, they then would download it to their phone/tablet, and then run it through this app to be decoded.PhotoCrypt uses advanced encryption and cipher algorithms to embed your secret message within a photo. You can be assured that anyone who does not know the correct password and the corresponding secure key will not be able to decode the message.The chances of brute forcing the correct passwords etc are in the order of 1 in 10 to the power of 80 or so if you use the build in random password generators. Considering that 1 billion (1,000,000,000) is 1 in 10 to the power of 9 and 1 trillion (1,000,000,000,000) is 1 in 10 to the power of 12, the chances of decoding any message randomly is extremely small.PhotoCrypt is a real and viable alternative to other encryption software. It is certainly less &apos;suspicious&apos; as your basic email message will not be coded and no-one would suspect the &apos;real&apos; message to be hidden within the attached photograph.It is ideal for storing sensitive information such as passwords, bank account information, basically anything that needs to be kept hidden and secure.PhotoCrypt can store a number of phrases which contain a complex password and secure key.For example, your email might say something like...\"Hello John, how&apos;s it going? I&apos;m just back from holiday. Aren&apos;t you jealous.... just look at my photo attached of me enjoying my cocktail drink. I will talk to you soon!\"The phrase &apos;enjoying my cocktail drink&apos; could be the phrase which was used to encrypt the photo with the secret message. If this &apos;phrase&apos; is detected within PhotoCrypt, it would automatically select the correct password and secure key for decoding the attached photo in your email.If you have the correct decode &apos;phrase&apos; for the photo, you will be able to view your secret message with ease!It is important to note that your encrypted photo will be a .png file format. PhotoCrypt will NOT be able to decode any photo which has been converted from the original encrypted .png format into a .jpg format. A number of websites including Facebook automatically convert any uploaded photo to a .jpg format.PhotoCrypt was designed and released as a tool to demonstrate encryption techniques and should be used for educational purposes only.\n"},
