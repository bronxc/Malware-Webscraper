It's compatible with VMware, VMware ESX, Citrix XenDesktop and Microsoft Hyper-V.\nUSB Network Gate is the ideal choice if you need to share a USB device in the office. Rather than changing existing network configurations, you can simply share an USB printer, scanner or other device on a single PC and then it can be accessed wirelessly from other desktops or laptops in the office.\nUSB Network Gate is probably more suited to a business environment, ideal if you are a network administrator.
