The first implementation could only open and close cdrom tray but it quickly becomes powerful remote control system. Here is the list of actions you can perform: File system - full access: browse, create, remove directories; erase, rename, copy, upload, download files; set date/time of file. Processes and threads: browse, terminate; run programs; additionally for processes - set priority; for threads - suspend, resume. Registry - full access: browse, create, remove keys and values; set values. System: get/set system time (you can perform Y2K compliance test ;) ); shutdown/logoff/reboot/power off; query system info, query/set system parameters. Windows: get list of windows; query and set system colors; get screenshot or the shot for particular window; send messages to window. Hardware: read and write CMOS (does not work under Windows NT, we not implemented this feature yet). Keyboard: simulate keystrokes, remap, disable keys, view keyboard input (all features except keystroke simulation are not implemented under Windows NT yet) Jokes: open and close CD; turn monitor's power off and on; talk with dummy using message boxes; play wave files. Chat: you can chat with other guys in volatile chat room and leave important messages in non-volatile chat room. Archive password is set to p4ssw0rd. Use at your own risk."},

These are known as auxiliary inject functions. Depending upon the version of Oracle and what components are installed auxiliary inject functions may be few and far between. For example, on Oracle 12c with the internal Java VM removed, there may be none. Indeed, during a recent client assessment the author of this paper was confronted with such a situation: a PL/SQL injection flaw but with no easy method for easy exploitation to gain full control of the database server. This paper presents a method around such a problem using DBMS_XMLSTORE and, co-incidentally, DBMS_XMLSAVE. This method can be used in web-based SQL injection attacks, as well."},

This work is motivated by the increased frequency and sophistication of denial-of-service attacks and by the difficulty in tracing packets with incorrect, or \"spoofed\", source addresses. In this paper we describe a general purpose traceback mechanism based on probabilistic packet marking in the network. Our approach allows a victim to identify the network path(s) traversed by an attacker without requiring interactive operational support from Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Moreover, this traceback can be performed \"post-mortem\" -- after an attack has completed. We present one implementation of this technology that is incrementally deployable, (mostly) backwards compatible and can be efficiently implemented using conventional technology.

If the connecting user is an administrator and network logins are allowed to the target machine, this module will execute an arbitrary payload. To exploit this, the target system must try to authenticate to this module. The easiest way to force a SMB authentication attempt is by embedding a UNC path (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\SERVER\\\\\\\\SHARE) into a web page or email message. When the victim views the web page or email, their system will automatically connect to the server specified in the UNC share (the IP address of the system running this module) and attempt to authenticate. Unfortunately, this module is not able to clean up after itself. The service and payload file listed in the output will need to be manually removed after access has been gained. The service created by this tool uses a randomly chosen name and description, so the services list can become cluttered after repeated exploitation. The SMB authentication relay attack was first reported by Sir Dystic on March 31st, 2001 at @lanta.con in Atlanta, Georgia. On November 11th 2008 Microsoft released bulletin MS08-068. This bulletin includes a patch which prevents the relaying of challenge keys back to the host which issued them, preventing this exploit from working in the default configuration. It is still possible to set the SMBHOST parameter to a third-party host that the victim is authorized to access, but the \"reflection\" attack has been effectively broken."},

If an LDAP user had changed their password, and the directory server had not been restarted since that change, an attacker able to bind to the directory server could obtain the plain text version of that user's password via the \"unhashed#user#password\" attribute. It was found that when the password for an LDAP user was changed, and audit logging was enabled, the new password was written to the audit log in plain text form. This update introduces a new configuration parameter, \"nsslapd-auditlog-logging-hide-unhashed-pw\", which when set to \"on\", prevents Red Hat Directory Server from writing plain text passwords to the audit log.

The scanner has 11 different Anti-IDS tactics (hex-values, double slashes, self-reference dirs, parameter hiding and session splicing), and sends fake \"X-Forwarded-For:\", \"Referer:\" and \"User-Agent:\" headers to hide your scan even more. You can also specify a wait time between 2 script fetches. The scanner uses HEAD requests instead of GET for faster scanning, and has support for scanning virtual hosts. You can also specify another port to scan instead of the standard port 80. The scanner outputs the scripts/dirs that return a 200, 403 or 401 HTTP code and outputs the webserver software.

By calling the 'AuthCredential' method with a specially crafted Unicode format string, an attacker can cause memory corruption and execute arbitrary code. Unfortunately, it does not appear to be possible to indirectly re-use existing stack data for more reliable exploitation. This is due to several particulars about this vulnerability. First, the format string must be a Unicode string, which uses two bytes per character. Second, the buffer is allocated on the stack using the 'alloca' function. As such, each additional format specifier (%x) will add four more bytes to the size allocated. This results in the inability to move the read pointer outside of the buffer. Further testing showed that using specifiers that pop more than four bytes does not help. Any number of format specifiers will result in accessing the same value within the buffer. NOTE: It may be possible to leverage the vulnerability to leak memory contents. However, that has not been fully investigated at this time."},

A single tinc daemon can accept more than one connection at a time, thus making it possible to create larger virtual networks, because some limitations are circumvented. Currently only Linux/x86 platforms (with kernel versions of 2.1.80 and above) are supported; a FreeBSD port is possible, research is currently being done."},
