Unlike other products, it can analyze the data packets (where they come from, where they go, which port and protocol they use). This makes it possible to distinguish between local and internet traffic for example. BWMeter can also be used for traffic control by setting a speed limit for all kinds of connections or restricting access of applications to certain internet sites. It creates statistics for all computers in your network, measuring and displaying all LAN traffic as well as download / upload from the internet. You can even define filters which show your transfer with certain internet addresses (e.g. to see how much data you download from your favorite news server). BWMeter is ideal for home users to get an overview of how much bandwidth they use, as well as small to large businesses, where one computer can control the traffic and maintain the statistics of downloaded / uploaded data of all computers in the network. The product is easy to configure and offers a rich set of options and features for beginners as well as experts and network administrators.\r"},

"description": "AVG Anti-Virus is a selection of anti-virus and internet security software developed by AVG technologies for multiple platforms including Windows, Mac and Linux.\r\nAVG technologies formerly known as Grisoft launched its first product named Anti-Virus Guard (AVG) in 1992 in Czechoslovakia, a simple but effective free anti-virus program for Windows. By 1998 the AVG software was introduced to Germany, UK and the U.S. with the free edition of the program raising awareness for AVG. With advances in computer software technology and a rise in internet security risks AVG evolved over the years to include a whole range of new security features in the AVG anti-virus package such as anti-spyware, root-kit protection, anti-spam, e-mail protection, web-browsing filter and a P2P monitor all working to effectively identify and eliminate security risks.\r\nAVG Anti-Virus is compatible with Windows XP/Vista/7 and Mac OS X and Mac OS Lion. Older versions of AVG Anti-Virus are still functional but are not supported with updates from AVG technologies; it is advised to use latest versions of AVG software as they include updates to its virus database making your PC safer.\r\nPros: Automatically installs updates, includes a number of internet security features making your PC safe, free edition available with range of features.\r\nCons: Regular registration pop-up window, tries to install browser modifications, no firewall included.

The Internet Lock blocks Internet traffic while your computer is unattended or while you are not using the Internet, and it can be activated automatically with your computer's screensaver or after a set period of inactivity.

communication protocols. It currently supports Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and Unix. Azureus was started at Sourceforge.net mostly to experiment with the Standard Widget Toolkit from Eclipse, in June 2003. It is possibly the most popular of all BitTorrent clients.\r Azureus allows the user to download multiple files in a single graphical user interface (GUI). The program also features detailed statistics and a large number of user-configurable settings. While downloading a torrent, the user can view many different statistics.\r Features include:Multiple torrent downloads\rUpload and download speed limiting, both globally and per torrent\rAdvanced seeding rules\rAdjustable disk cache\rOnly uses one port for all the torrents\rUPnP sets the forward on your router\rCan use a proxy, for both tracker and peer communications\rFast resume\rCan set a default download directory and move completed files\rCan import torrents automatically from a set directory\rHighly customizable interface\rIRC plugin included for quick help\rEmbedded tracker, host your own torrents, automate your shares\rDistributed Hash Table: host on it a completely decentralized torrent and/or benefit from it when the tracker is offline.

They are either ugly, slow, lack functions or, more often, all three. Will PDF-XChange Viewer be any different?\r It is! Viewing PDFs with PDF-XChange Viewer is fast and smooth - you can skip through and back pages, view documents in a variety of layouts, and search and find pages and keywords seamlessly. PDF-XChange Viewer's toolbars are totally customizable, and there is a considerable range of configuration options.\r PDF-XChange Viewer's editing options are also impressive. Although the free version doesn't allow you to create documents from scratch, it does let you edit extensively, with a few exceptions, mainly the ability to add or remove pages. Commenting, underlining, stamping, attaching files and creating text boxes are all easily done, and can be modified and removed in the click of a button.\r There are also tooltips, so you know what you are doing before you click. This feature is very welcome, as the PDF-XChange Viewer help is not very good. Additional cool features include a snapshot tool, document preview when opening PDFs and a huge range of interface language options."}
