There is a server side (Linux only) and a client side (Windows and Linux). This application is similar to FWKnop and more of an academic/proof of concept application as opposed to a full blown commercial quality application. involves a client that creates a packet with a payload encrypted with the public half of two different RSA keys. The idea is that one key would be shared by all users and it would encrypt the user name of the individual. A second key specific to each individual user would encrypt a pre-shared key (just any old string, nothing secret about it really) and a timestamp (to counter replay attacks). The server would receive this packet and decrypt this first half of the packet, which would give us the user name of the person sending the packet. The server would then know which user specific second key to use to decrypt the pre-shared key and time stamp to evaluate them for acceptability. If all is good, then the server would open up a port for the semi-public service we were trying to conceal for a brief amount of time to allow for a connection to be made.

This is similar to 'ssh -L' functionality, but does not use SSH and requires a pre-shared symmetric key. Spiped uses strong and well-understood cryptographic components: The initial key negotiation is performed using HMAC-SHA256 and an authenticated Diffie-Hellman key exchange over the standard 2048-bit \"group 14\"; following the completion of key negotiation, packets are transmitted encrypted with AES-256 in CTR mode and authenticated using HMAC-SHA256."},

Cryptfuscate Bundle consists of two main scripts, cryptfuscate.pl and executer.pl. cryptfuscate.pl creates an encrypted version of Perl module embedded text files using Blowfish AES encryption and encodes the module in base 64. executer.pl then can be packaged with the encrypted module and placed on a target's box. executer.pl can then be launched and given the correct encryption key and salt will decrypt the module, handle the module as a string, and execute the module using Perl's eval() function. This method of execution provides you with a safe and secure way to execute Perl code while keeping local users from being able to analyze the source code of your module. Cryptfuscate Bundle comes with a module to experiment with, a bind shell on port 62221."},

They effectively proxy SSL connections, inserting their own certificate as a trusted authority in the system store and then replace all leaf certificates on-the-fly. This is why if you examine a certificate when using Kaspersky Antivirus, the issuer appears to be \"Kaspersky Anti-Virus Personal Root\". Kaspersky's certificate interception has previously resulted in serious vulnerabilities, but quick review finds many simple problems still exist. For example, the way leaf certificates are cached uses an extremely naive fingerprinting technique. Kaspersky cache recently generated certificates in memory in case the user agent initiates another connection. In order to do this, Kaspersky fetches the certificate chain and then checks if it's already generated a matching leaf certificate in the cache. If it has, it just grabs the existing certificate and private key and then reuses it for the new connection. The cache is a binary tree, and as new leaf certificates and keys are generated, they're inserted using the first 32 bits of MD5(serialNumber||issuer) as the key. If a match is found for a key, they just pull the previously generated certificate and key out of the binary tree and start using it to relay data to the user-agent. You don't have to be a cryptographer to understand a 32bit key is not enough to prevent brute-forcing a collision in seconds. In fact, producing a collision with any other certificate is trivial."},

First, they present Logjam, a novel flaw in TLS that lets a man-in-the-middle downgrade connections to \"export-grade\" Diffie-Hellman. To carry out this attack, the researchers implement the number field sieve discrete log algorithm. After a week-long precomputation for a specified 512-bit group, they can compute arbitrary discrete logs in that group in about a minute. They found that 82% of vulnerable servers use a single 512-bit group, allowing them to compromise connections to 7% of Alexa Top Million HTTPS sites. They go on to consider Diffie-Hellman with 768- and 1024-bit groups. They estimate that even in the 1024-bit case, the computations are plausible given nation-state resources. A small number of fixed or standardized groups are used by millions of servers; performing precomputation for a single 1024-bit group would allow passive eavesdropping on 18% of popular HTTPS sites, and a second group would allow decryption of traffic to 66% of IPsec VPNs and 26% of SSH servers. A close reading of published NSA leaks shows that the agency's attacks on VPNs are consistent with having achieved such a break. They conclude that moving to stronger key exchange methods should be a priority for the Internet community."},

When using the logon session option (CRYPTPROTECTMEMORY_SAME_LOGON flag) the encryption key is generated based on the logon session identifier, this is for sharing memory between processes running within the same logon. As this might also be used for sending data from one process to another it supports extracting the logon session id from the impersonation token. The issue is the implementation in CNG.sys doesn't check the impersonation level of the token when capturing the logon session id (using SeQueryAuthenticationIdToken) so a normal user can impersonate at Identification level and decrypt or encrypt data for that logon session. This might be an issue if there's a service which is vulnerable to a named pipe planting attack or is storing encrypted data in a world readable shared memory section. This is the proof of concept code that demonstrates the issue. This affects Windows 7, 8.1 Update 32/64 bit."},

The high resolution and low noise of the Flush+Reload attack enables a spy program to recover over 98% of the bits of the private key in a single decryption or signing round. Unlike previous attacks, the attack targets the last level L3 cache. Consequently, the spy program and the victim do not need to share the execution core of the CPU. The attack is not limited to a traditional OS and can be used in a virtualised environment, where it can attack programs executing in a different VM."},

This method of execution provides you with a safe and secure way to execute Perl code while keeping local users from being able to analyze the source code of your module.

HID's iCLASS cards are widely used contactless smart cards for physical access control. Although INCrypt32 is a heart of the security of HID's iCLASS systems, its security has not been evaluated yet since the specification has not been open to public. In this paper, they reveal the specification of INCrypt32 by reverse engineering an iCLASS card and investigate the security of INCrypt32. As a result, we show that the secret key of size 64 bits can be recovered using only 218 MAC queries if the attacker can request MAC for chosen messages of arbitrary length. If the length of messages is limited to pre-determined values by the authentication protocol, the required number of MAC queries grows to 242 to recover the secret key."},

The idea is that one key would be shared by all users and it would encrypt the user name of the individual. A second key specific to each individual user would encrypt a pre-shared key (just any old string, nothing secret about it really) and a timestamp (to counter replay attacks). The server would receive this packet and decrypt this first half of the packet, which would give us the user name of the person sending the packet. The server would then know which user specific second key to use to decrypt the pre-shared key and time stamp to evaluate them for acceptability.

The consequences of these attacks range from throughput-reduction to broken connections or data corruption. These attacks rely on the attacker's ability to guess or know the four- tuple (Source Address, Destination Address, Source port, Destination Port) that identifies the transport protocol instance to be attacked. This document describes a simple and efficient method for random selection of the client port number, such that the possibility of an attacker guessing the exact value is reduced. While this is not a replacement for cryptographic methods, the described port number randomization algorithms provide improved security/obfuscation with very little effort and without any key management overhead. Both text and pdf formats of this paper are included."},

This patch eliminates three newly found vulnerabilities affecting SQL Server 2000 and MSDE 2000: A buffer overrun vulnerability in a procedure used to encrypt SQL Server credential information. An attacker who was able to successfully exploit this vulnerability could gain significant control over the database and possibly the server itself depending on the account SQL Server runs as. A buffer overrun vulnerability in a procedure that relates to the bulk inserting of data in SQL Server tables. An attacker who was able to successfully exploit this vulnerability could gain significant control over the database and possibly the server itself. A privilege elevation vulnerability that results because of incorrect permissions on the Registry key that stores the SQL Server service account information. An attacker who was able to successfully exploit this vulnerability could gain greater privileges on the system than had been granted by the system administrator -- potentially even the same rights as the operating system."},
