On-the-fly encryption means that data are automatically encrypted or decrypted right before they are loaded or saved, without any user intervention. No data stored on an encrypted volume can be read (decrypted) without using the correct password or correct encryption key. Until decrypted, a TrueCrypt volume appears to be nothing more than a series of random numbers. The entire file system is encrypted (i.e., file names, folder names, contents of every file, and free space).\nThis software is highly recommended for securing data on laptops.\nTrueCrypt performs the following tasks:\n\nCreates a virtual encrypted disk within a file and mounts it as a real disk.\nEncrypts an entire partition or storage device such as USB flash drive or hard drive.\nEncrypts a partition or drive where Windows is installed (pre-boot authentication).\nEncryption is automatic, real-time (on-the-fly) and transparent.\nProvides two levels of plausible deniability, in case an adversary forces you to reveal the password: 1) Hidden volume (steganography) and hidden operating system.  2) No TrueCrypt volume can be identified (volumes cannot be distinguished from random data).\nEncryption algorithms: AES-256, Serpent, and Twofish. Mode of operation: XTS.\n\nPlease Note: According to the programs author, TrueCrypt is not secure because it could contain unfixed security issues, therefore you should download TrueCrypt only if you are migrating data encrypted by TrueCrypt.\nAs The development of TrueCrypt was ended in 5/2014 you should migrate any data encrypted by TrueCrypt to encrypted disks or virtual disk images supported on your platform.\n"},

You can also do the reverse; send video from an Android and iOS mobile device and burn it immediately, thanks to the updated \"AirBurn\" feature.\nLike many other products in the Nero range, Nero 2016 Classic has support for geotagging, called \"Places\". That means media filmed on a smartphone, tablet or other compatible device can be organised by its location metadata.\nThe software has also been updated with a new look and feel. The brand new launcher is now organized into five sections: \"Manage & Play\", \"Edit & Convert\", \"Rip & Burn\", \"Backup & Rescue\", and \"Extras\".\nThe help section has also been improved in this version, with comprehensive guides to walk you through the process of managing content and completing projects.\nWhile Nero 2016 Classic is a slimmed down version of its big brother, it still has support for cloud storage in various ways. Nero BackItUp is essentially a storage service that lets you access and play back content from anywhere. Media is organised by date in MediaHome, Nero's content manager, and segmented according to media type as well.\nNero 2016 Classic, also houses some really cool modules. Nero Recode, for example, rips disc contents or regular audio and video files, and converts them to a particular format, to play on a certain device, or burn them to disc. Nero Burning ROM is again at the the core of the package; burning CDs, DVDs or Blu-rays. With it, you can optionally encrypt your content or split it across multiple discs. If you run the suite on a dual monitor system, then you'll be able to preview your content full-screen on the second display as well.\nThe downside of Nero 2016 Classic, is you lose the ability to play back Ultra HD (4K). Otherwise, apart form extra content and video effects and the \"stashimi\" recorder, the main difference between this and the Platinum suite is the price tag.\n"},

CrococryptFile, for instance, encrypts all file and folder information including file names, time/date and file size information, and it also disguises any information of the archive's content, because all data and meta-data is simply integrated into a giant file dump.\nOverall, CrococryptFile is a really useful tool that reliably allows you to encode important files and thereby renders them inaccessible to any other unauthorized users. The utility allows you to add individual files to a password-protected archive, which the encodes the file name, time/date, as well as the file size information. As the application integrates with the Windows Explorer context menu, you can also right-click on the desired file and start the encoding process.\n"},

{"name": "DVD Shrink", "link": "http://filehippo.com/download_dvdshrink/", "appVersions": {}, "author": "DVD Shrink", "description": "\nDVDShrink is software to backup DVD discs. You can use this software in conjunction with DVD burning software of your choice, to make a backup copy of any DVD video disc.\nDVDShrink will also burn your backup DVD, if you have installed the latest version of Nero. If you already possess alternative burning software and prefer to stick with it, then you can still use DVD Shrink. The output from DVDShrink can be saved as files on your hard drive, which you can then burn with software of your choice.\nWhy Use DVDShrink?\nMost DVDs are designed to prevent you from making copies.\nThe first preventative measure is encryption. Commercial DVD titles are often encrypted, which prevents you from either copying them to your hard drive, or if you manage to do so, being able to play the resulting files. DVDShrink overcomes this problem with built-in decryption algorithms.\nThe next problem is not so easy. Most DVD video titles are simply too large to fit, without modification, onto a single recordable DVD-R disk. DVDShrink overcomes this problem by compressing or \"shrinking\" the data from your original DVD.\nDVDShrink also allows you to re-author your DVD.

With everyday threats to data, more and more people are opting for encrypted services. ProtonMail is high up the list for secure email services, and for good reason.\r\n\n\nSecure services\r\n\n\r\nWhen you use ProtonMail, there are many layers of protection securing your data. First of all email is stored encrypted on servers. This means that ProtonMail staff have no access to the data. The servers themselves make use of fully encrypted hard disks with multiple password layers, so data security is preserved even if the hardware is seized or compromised.\r\n\n\r\nNext, ProtonMail uses end-to-end encryption for encrypted messages, using secure implementations of the open source AES, RSA, and OpenPGP libraries including, TLS 1.0, AES-128 CBC, DHE RSA handshake, and SHA3 hash authentication. The SSL certificates are signed by SwissSign.\r\n\n\r\nProtonMail accounts are protected by two passwords. The first* is used to authenticate the user and to retrieve the correct account, and the second is kept only by the user, and is used to decrypt their mailbox. If you send an email to a non-ProtonMail user, you can choose a password that only the recipient will know.\r\n\n\nPricing\r\n\n\r\nProtonMail provides a free plan, with paid for plans starting with ProtonMail Plus, priced at $5/month or $48/year, and ProtonMail Visionary, priced at $30/month or $288/year. The basic ProtonMail service is free, however, with users on the free plan receive a sending limit of 50 messages/hour and 150 messages/day, a labels limit of 20, 500 MB of storage. The basic plan does not support custom domains or additional email addresses, and it has limited customer support. The ProtonMail Plus and Proton Mail Visionary plans have increased storage capacity, support for custom domains, additional email addresses, increased label limits and better customer support. \r\n\n\nBottom Line\r\n\n\r\nOverall, ProtonMail, for the most part, provides a high level of privacy, and being based in Switzerland, it \u2018should\u2019 be resilient against most forms of attack.

It supports 40+ popular \r\n\r\nbrowsers, including Edge, IE, Firefox, and Chrome, as well as more than 200 other applications. This basically means that your activity remains private \r\n\r\nwithout changing the way you use your computer or restricting your online activities.\nIt defeats key-loggers by encrypting your keystrokes at the keyboard driver level. If a key-logger does manage to record your keystrokes, they will only \r\n\r\nbe able to record the encrypted keys that are, obviously indecipherable.\nAs KeyScrambler Personal mostly works in the background, you will normally not notice it in operation. It does, however, have an intuitive interface \r\n\r\nthat provides you with easy access to all of the application's features: When you start typing in a supported browser, you can see a banner at the top of \r\n\r\nyour active window, which shows the encrypted text as you are typing. If you right-click on the tray icon, it allows you to open the Options menu. This is \r\n\r\nwhere you can do things like set a hotkey for turning the application on and off etc.\nOverall, KeyScrambler Personal is a good tool for evading key-loggers, and it does not interfere with your daily use of other applications on your \r\n\r\ncomputer.\n"},

When their job is the network and the network is what drives their company, there is no such thing as a day off. LogicMonitor is a cloud-based solution that lets your IT team monitor the network infrastructure quickly and easily. This allows them to take corrective action before small issues turn into full-blown catastrophes.\r\n\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t your everyday DIY tool; it\u2019s for IT professionals who specialize in highly specified functions such as network management, data center networking, storage, and CSPs (Cloud Services Providers).\r\n\n\nMulti-platform Alerts\r\nAlerts for detected problems are sent through email, text to speech phone message, text message, web-hooks, or the web. They can also be routed to different groups based on your company\u2019s protocol for device type (like a company mobile device department), severity of the issue, or time of day. The built-in threat hierarchy decides whether an issue is severe enough to warrant an immediate alert versus waiting until the office is open, as well as determining whether the alert needs to be immediate (a middle of the night phone call) versus less severe, which would only require an email.\r\n\n\nActiveDiscovery\r\nActiveDiscovery automatically monitors newly added devices, eliminating the need for manual configuration of new devices every time a new hire or a replacement device comes along. Once a device is detected, ActiveDiscovery kicks in and looks for interfaces, physical disks, volumes, temperature sensors, virtual IPs, VPN links, applications, and more.\r\n\n\nData Security\r\nLogicMonitor is a hosted service for Windows or Linux, but there\u2019s no need to change your firewall settings. Instead, you\u2019ll upload a very lightweight Java-based data collector on a host within your firewall; the connection between the collector and LogicMonitor is both encrypted and outgoing-only. Any data you choose to send to LogicMonitor, such as IP addresses, is stored and encrypted in the software\u2019s databases. \r\n\n\nData Storage\r\nLogicMonitor stores data for up to one year, giving you the option to see historical trends, detect usage patterns, and plot your requirements for future network growth. \r\n\n\nPricing\r\nLogicMonitor uses a subscription pricing model, with a free trial available. A standard monthly subscription includes: unlimited users & collectors, performance monitoring of anything in your stack, unlimited free email & SMS alerts, alert routing & escalation, historical trending data stored for 1 year, Syslog monitoring, event monitoring, Batch Job monitoring, remote sessions, and customizable dashboards with dynamic content. For a quote, please contact Logic Monitor for more information.\r\n\n\nBottom Line\r\nLogicMonitor is a great way to monitor the network infrastructure quickly and easily. With components including ActiveDiscovery (TM) automated detection, device management and configuration configuration, applications and databases, ActiveIntelligence (TM) with preconfigured and fully customizable alerts, reporting and dashboards, and engineer-grade live support via phone, email or chat whenever needed, it is no wonder Logic Monitor receives rave review from their clients.\r\n\n"},

On-the-fly encryption means that data are automatically encrypted or decrypted right before they are loaded or saved, without any user intervention. No data stored on an encrypted volume can be read (decrypted) without using the correct password or correct encryption key. Until decrypted, a TrueCrypt volume appears to be nothing more than a series of random numbers. The entire file system is encrypted (i.e., file names, folder names, contents of every file, and free space).\nThis software is highly recommended for securing data on laptops.\nTrueCrypt performs the following tasks:\n\nCreates a virtual encrypted disk within a file and mounts it as a real disk.\nEncrypts an entire partition or storage device such as USB flash drive or hard drive.\nEncrypts a partition or drive where Windows is installed (pre-boot authentication).\nEncryption is automatic, real-time (on-the-fly) and transparent.\nProvides two levels of plausible deniability, in case an adversary forces you to reveal the password: 1) Hidden volume (steganography) and hidden operating system.  2) No TrueCrypt volume can be identified (volumes cannot be distinguished from random data).\nEncryption algorithms: AES-256, Serpent, and Twofish. Mode of operation: XTS.\n\nPlease Note: According to the programs author, TrueCrypt is not secure because it could contain unfixed security issues, therefore you should download TrueCrypt only if you are migrating data encrypted by TrueCrypt.\nAs The development of TrueCrypt was ended in 5/2014 you should migrate any data encrypted by TrueCrypt to encrypted disks or virtual disk images supported on your platform.\n"},

ProtonMail is high up the list for secure email services, and for good reason.\r\n\n\nSecure services\r\n\n\r\nWhen you use ProtonMail, there are many layers of protection securing your data. First of all email is stored encrypted on servers. This means that ProtonMail staff have no access to the data. The servers themselves make use of fully encrypted hard disks with multiple password layers, so data security is preserved even if the hardware is seized or compromised.\r\n\n\r\nNext, ProtonMail uses end-to-end encryption for encrypted messages, using secure implementations of the open source AES, RSA, and OpenPGP libraries including, TLS 1.0, AES-128 CBC, DHE RSA handshake, and SHA3 hash authentication. The SSL certificates are signed by SwissSign.\r\n\n\r\nProtonMail accounts are protected by two passwords. The first* is used to authenticate the user and to retrieve the correct account, and the second is kept only by the user, and is used to decrypt their mailbox. If you send an email to a non-ProtonMail user, you can choose a password that only the recipient will know.\r\n\n\nPricing\r\n\n\r\nProtonMail provides a free plan, with paid for plans starting with ProtonMail Plus, priced at $5/month or $48/year, and ProtonMail Visionary, priced at $30/month or $288/year.

It runs on Windows NT 4 and higher and its output lists Registry and file system API discrepancies that may indicate the presence of a user-mode or kernel-mode rootkit.\nRootkitRevealer successfully detects many persistent rootkits including AFX, Vanquish and HackerDefender (note: RootkitRevealer is not intended to detect rootkits like Fu that don't attempt to hide their files or registry keys).\nSince persistent rootkits work by changing API results so that a system view using APIs differs from the actual view in storage, RootkitRevealer compares the results of a system scan at the highest level with that at the lowest level. The highest level is the Windows API and the lowest level is the raw contents of a file system volume or Registry hive (a hive file is the Registry's on-disk storage format).\nThus, rootkits, whether user mode or kernel mode, that manipulate the Windows API or native API to remove their presence from a directory listing, for example, will be seen by RootkitRevealer as a discrepancy between the information returned by the Windows API and that seen in the raw scan of a FAT or NTFS volume's file system structures.\n"},

You can also convert an image to black and white, or sepia.\nIn order to navigate multiple images easily, Paint.NET uses a tabbed document interface. The tabs display a live thumbnail of the image instead of a text description.\nPaint.NET uses a layers system to form the basis for rich image composition.

tidy open source web browser. At its public launch in 2004 Mozilla Firefox was the first browser to challenge Microsoft Internet Explorer\u2019s dominance. Since then, Mozilla Firefox has consistently featured in the top 3 most popular browsers globally. The key features that have made Mozilla Firefox so popular are the simple and effective UI, browser speed and strong security capabilities. The browser is particularly popular with developers thanks to its open source development and active community of advanced users.\nEasier Browsing\nMozilla put of a lot of resources into creating a simple but effective UI aimed at making browsing quicker and easier. They created the tab structure that has been adopted by most other browsers. In recent years Mozilla has also focused on maximizing browsing area by simplifying toolbar controls to just a Firefox button (which contains settings and options) and back/forward buttons. The URL box features direct Google searching as well as an auto predict/history feature called Awesome Bar. On the right side of the URL box there are bookmarking, history and refresh buttons. To the right of the URL box is a search box which allows you to customize your search engine options. Outside of that a view button controls what you see below the URL. Next to that you have the download history and home buttons.\nSpeed\nMozilla Firefox boasts impressive page load speeds thanks to the excellent JagerMonkey JavaScript engine. Start up speed and graphics rendering are also among the quickest in the market.  Firefox manages complex video and web content using layer-based Direct2D and Driect3D graphics systems. Crash protection ensures only the plugin causing the issue stops working, not the rest of the content being browsed. Reloading the page restarts any affected plugins. The tab system and Awesome Bar have been streamlined to launch/get results very quickly too.\nSecurity\nFirefox was the first browser to introduce a private browsing feature which allows you to use the internet more anonymously and securely. History, searches, passwords, downloads, cookies and cached content are all removed on shutdown. Minimizing the chances of another user stealing your identity or finding confidential information.  Content security, anti-phishing technology and antivirus/antimalware integration ensures your browsing experience is as safe as possible.\nPersonalisation & Development\nOne of the best features of the Firefox UI is customization. Simply right click on the navigation toolbar to customize individual components or just drag and drop items you want to move around. The inbuilt Firefox Add-ons Manager allows you to discover and install add-ons within the browser as well as view ratings, recommendations and descriptions.  Read more about the top recommended add-ons for Mozilla Firefox. Thousands of customizable themes allow you to customize the look and feel of your browser. Site authors and developers can create advanced content and applications using Mozilla\u2019s open source platform and enhanced API.\nLooking for the Mac version of Firefox?

{"name": "Code42 CrashPlan", "link": "http://filehippo.com/web_code42-crashplan/", "appVersions": {}, "author": "Code42 Software, Inc.", "description": "\n\r\nCode42 CrashPlan is a solid, off-site back up solution, designed for enterprise, which automatically ensures all your data is secure, always. It offers on-demand scalability with contained maintenance costs, whilst all data is encrypted and securely backed up to CrashPlan central.\r\n\n\r\nWith Code42 CrashPlan, your firm can protect end-user data in a single repository. The platform allows you to view the most important information about your back ups at a glance, including when the next back up is scheduled, how much is left, when the last back up was completed and how much data was included in the process.\r\n\n\r\nCode42's data centers all comply with strict security standards and conform to industry best practices for power redundancy, and cooling & protection symptoms. Code42 CrashPlan uses 448-bit Blowfish encryption to ensure your data is always as secure as possible. The data is transferred to Code42 servers using standard 128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) protocol. Users files are encrypted before they leave the computer and then transferred to Code42 securely.\r\n\n\r\nIf \u2019lost\u2019 files need to be recovered, any authorized user is able to retrieve the data. Users simply open CrashPlan and select the files or folders they need to restore. The back up settings can be adjusted with highly flexible, fine-grained controls. \r\n\nAutomatic Backups\r\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what OS your business uses, Code42 CrashPlan protects every version of every file on laptops and desktops running Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. There are no limits on the types, sizes, or numbers of files that an organization, or indeed an individual employee, is able to protect.\r\n\n\r\nCode42 CrashPlan backs up data automatically; there is no need to continually configure the process. This ensures that you are able to retain complete access to every version of every file that you have created. The service also gives you access to deleted files.\r\n\nSelf-Healing Archives\r\nWith Code42 CrashPlan in place, you never have to worry about the integrity of your data backups and whether they can be utilized any time you need them. Code42 CrashPlan is able to run regular health checks of all backup archives.\r\n\n\r\nA very useful aspect of Code42 CrashPlan is that it automatically checks for data corruption, and in the event that unusable blocks of data are discovered, the app will re-request the affected data blocks from the source device, to begin self-healing the archive. These self-healing archives run without any interference from the end-user at all.\r\n\nReal-Time Reporting\r\nAnother great feature of Code42 CrashPlan is its real-time reporting tools that enable users to visually monitor the health of their data systems at any given time. Users are able to view backups, licensing, and storage 24/7. If a data breach does ever happen to occur, or some form of ransomware is discovered, then automated alerts and notifications are sent from the Code42 admin console.\r\n\nIntegrations\r\nCode42 CrashPlan has seamless integration with Splunk Cloud. Splunk Cloud is an enterprise solution for data analytics monitoring and visualization. It affords users added functionality for reporting and analytics, and server and endpoint data monitoring. Code42 CrashPlan also offers an open API.\r\n\nPricing\r\nCode42 CrashPlan uses a Subscription pricing model with plans starting from only $5.00 per month, with a free trial available (no credit card required). For $5 per user, per month you receive CrashPlan endpoint and restore, and for $10 per user, per month you receive CrashPlan, and Cloud Storage.\r\n\nBottom Line\r\nOverall, Code42 CrashPlan is a solid way for enterprises to continuously back up all end-user data, whilst affording complete control and transparency via a single, secure platform. The service imposes no limits on type, size or number of files that can be protected.
