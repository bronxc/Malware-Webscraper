What we really have is a daily reprieve contingent on the maintenance of our spiritual condition. This app helps US maintain THAT spiritual condition.My Spiritual Toolkit (MST), also known as 12 Steps AA Toolkit App, is the ORIGINAL App created over 5 years ago for people in recovery to make it easier for you and other members of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) to get your daily reprieve and maintain your spiritual condition.  Resentment is the number one offender.  Now you can get rid of your resentments fast while on the go with the Spot Check Inventory tool that\u2019s mentioned in Step 10 of the Twelve and Twelve to help with our daily ups and downs, especially those where people or new events throw us off balance and tempt us to make mistakes.Do you do a Nightly Inventory as suggested in Step 11 of the Big Book before retiring each night?   You should and now It\u2019s EASY!  With 12 Steps AA Toolkit just answer 10 simple questions straight from the Big Book and you\u2019re done!  * Read the AA Daily Reflections Fast!  Quickly get your daily reflection for the day direct from the Alcoholics Anonymous website.* We are only as sick as our secrets and the alcoholics anonymous recovery program is all about sharing with others, particularly our sponsors.  So the 12 Steps Toolkit has a super feature for sharing your inventories, journal and gratitude lists with your sponsor or trusted adviser.  Simply Text or Email your sponsor right from within the app and get feedback fast!* The spot check inventory tool is similar to a mini step 4 inventory. You can create different inventories based on the big book style - resentment, fear, sex and harms done. * App features a sobriety calculator which keeps track of number of days you are sober for. Just set your sobriety date in the counter and it will automatically calculate how many days you\u2019ve been sober, years sober, months sober, even hours!  Even more fun, you can share this with your sponsor or other trusted advisers from right within the 12 Step Toolkit App!* You also have an Online Journal you can use to clear your head of unwanted racing thoughts and irrational fears before you fall asleep at night. Get those crazy thoughts out of your head and into your journal!  Plus you will be able to read old journal entries to see how far you've come.* Gratitude List - Your recovery program is not complete without the gratitude list tool. This pro tool will take your sobriety to the next level.* PIN locking will keep your info safe and secure for your eyes only.* Do you prefer to type on a computer? You can use the accompanying My Spiritual Toolkit Web app from any browser for free!  No other app offers this feature!Prayers included:- Serenity Prayer- Big Book Third Step Prayer and Seventh Step PrayerThe Spot Check Inventory (think mini 4th step) allows you to quickly get rid of resentments when on the go and you can later add more detail via your computer because all data is encrypted and securely synced to the cloud using the same security as banks!* You can create different spot check inventories based on the big book style - resentment, fear, sex and harms done.Just because you\u2019re a recovering alcoholic doesn't mean life will slow down. Instead it will move forward, and so must you. Often times moving forward means being on the constant go. In effect, this means that if you\u2019re using journaling as part of your recovery from alcoholism, then you don\u2019t have time to sit down and write your feelings out.* The 12 Steps AA Toolkit Recovery App ICON- To protect anonymity, app icon does not show Alcoholics Anonymous references.- Hardship discounts are available for anyone in re that can't afford the $2.99 premium features.\nAA 12 Steps App Alcoholics for Android official Trailer\n\n\n\n"},

It has a Journal that makes it easy to find time to write in your journal. Just have access to an internet connection at home (computer) or on the go (mobile devices and tablets) and journal via typing. It has the Just For Today meditation text from the Narcotics Anonymous fellowship's JFTNA.ORG website.It also has a Spot Check Inventory that allows you to quickly get rid of resentments when on the go and you can later add more detail via your computer because all data is securely synced to the cloud using the same security as banks!Just because you\u2019re a recovering drug addict doesn't mean life will slow down. Instead it will move forward, and so must you. Often times moving forward means being on the constant go. In effect, this means that if you\u2019re using journaling as part of your recovery, then you don\u2019t have time to sit down and write your feelings out.There\u2019s another problem that arises with paper journaling: privacy. If you mistakenly leave your journal out, someone might \u201caccidentally\u201d read it. Although a journal is a private matter and it\u2019s likely closed, people nowadays will still somehow invite themselves to opening your journal; thus, reading your private thoughts.Oh, what scandals can occur from private information!It\u2019s so good to know that both of these situations are avoidable \u2013 thanks to this App!FEATURES:\u2022 JOURNALWith the journal, you simply type in an entry. Whatever you want to express \u2013 anger, sadness, joy, etc. \u2013 do so with the assurance that your thoughts will remain private. This is because all data is encrypted; you\u2019re the only person who will have access to it. If you want to add an extra sense of security for your own peace of mind, create a fictitious name.Remember, however, that you\u2019re the only writer and reader in NAT\u2019s journal. In addition, you can edit and delete entries at any time.\u2022 GRATITUDE LIST- Enter Your Gratitude's while one the go!  - Hardship discounts are available for anyone that can't afford the $2.99 premium features.\u2022 SPOT CHECK INVENTORIES- With Spot Check Inventories, this is an opportunity to quickly express your resentment. When you\u2019re angry, you need to dispose this emotion fast so that it won\u2019t eat at your soul throughout the remainder of the day.\u2022 CLEAN CALCULATOR- View how long you've been clean each time the app is opened- Calculate the clean length of all your friends\u2022 ANONYMOUS ICON- To protect anonymity, the actual app icon does not show references to NAHow NAT Gives You PrivacyWhile NAT eliminates the possibility of losing your journal, it\u2019s even better that it gives you something more priceless: privacy.As mentioned earlier, all data is encrypted and password protected. Using the same security as banks, your data is transmitted over SSL.So, go ahead, write whatever you\u2019re feeling. Whether you hate your spouse, feel attracted to someone else, tempted to slap your boss \u2026 whatever, just type in your journal without the fear of being discovered and judged.ConclusionWith the help of journaling, you\u2019re accomplishing the hard task of recovering from drug addiction.Don\u2019t sacrifice journaling by not having time. And don\u2019t lose your privacy by having it invaded. Instead gain convenience and privacy while on the go with the Narcotics Anonymous Toolkit App.\n"},

These are important areas of learning and development that all domiciliary workers should understand and put into practice to ensure the people they support (service users) receive the high standard of care they deserve. These include;\u2022\tValues and Behaviours covering; what are values; what is person centred practice and interactive exercises to test workers understanding; what is the difference between respect and dignity, what are the NISCC Standards of Conduct and Practice for Social Care Workers and scenarios to help explain what these mean in day to day practice.\u2022\tSafeguarding covering; what adult safeguarding means, what are the types and signs of abuse; scenarios to explain/test how a worker might know that abuse is happening. This section also includes information on adult safeguarding champions, domestic abuse and safeguarding children. \u2022\tService user health and well-being covering key information to help workers promote the health and wellbeing of the service users. This includes; the dos and don\u2019ts for administration of medication and the NISCC Guidance on Administration of Medication, skin care (including pressure sores), infection control, hand washing, person protective equipment (PPE), safe food handling and why risk assessments are important and should be adhered to.\u2022\tService Areas and Pathways \u2013 this is a new section (added in 2016) and includes information on dementia, delirium and end of life care. This section aims to help raise awareness of these important and complex conditions and to provide guidance to improve workers day to day practice.Every year workers complete mandatory and workplace training around the above topics. If they are not immediately putting this learning and knowledge into practice they may not be able to remember what to do when a situation arises. The App provides the above information in a succinct/bite size format. It provides a quick reference tool to help refresh learning, as and when the worker needs it. This enables the care worker to consider and reflect on the values and types of behaviour required for good and safe practise. It reminds the care worker about the NISCC Standards, about person centred practices etc. The App also includes; scenario based exercises from practise and relevant videos and other information to enhance understanding and improve service delivery. The content of this App has been updated (2016) to reflect changes in current policy and to bring it up to date.The App has been developed and produced by the Northern Ireland Social Care Council (NISSC) in partnership with domiciliary care providers; Bryson Care and Extra Care, representatives from the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust, the Safeguarding Board, the Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority (RQIA), the Social Care Institute for Excellence (SCIE), the DHSSPS/DoH and Dementia Together NI/Delivering Social Care Change project.\n"},

It has a Recovery Journal that makes it easy to find time to write in your journal. Just have access to an internet connection at home (computer) or on the go (mobile devices and tablets) and journal via typing. It also has a Spot Check Inventory that allows you to quickly get rid of resentments when on the go and you can later add more detail via your computer because all data is securely synced to the cloud using the same security as banks! Just because you\u2019re in recovery doesn't mean life will slow down. Instead it will move forward, and so must you. Often times moving forward means being on the constant go. In effect, this means that if you\u2019re using journaling as part of your recovery, then you don\u2019t have time to sit down and write your feelings out. There\u2019s another problem that arises with paper journaling: privacy. If you mistakenly leave your journal out, someone might \u201caccidentally\u201d read it. Although a journal is a private matter and it\u2019s likely closed, people nowadays will still somehow invite themselves to opening your journal; thus, reading your private thoughts. Oh, what scandals can occur from private information! It\u2019s so good to know that both of these situations are avoidable \u2013 thanks to this MRT App! FEATURES: \u2022 JOURNAL With the journal, you simply type in an entry. Whatever you want to express \u2013 anger, sadness, joy, etc. \u2013 do so with the assurance that your thoughts will remain private. This is because all data is encrypted; you\u2019re the only person who will have access to it. If you want to add an extra sense of security for your own peace of mind, create a fictitious name. Remember, however, that you\u2019re the only writer and reader in MRT\u2019s journal. In addition, you can edit and delete entries at any time. \u2022 SPOT CHECK INVENTORIES - With Spot Check Inventories, this is an opportunity to quickly express your resentment. When you\u2019re angry, you need to dispose this emotion fast so that it won\u2019t eat at your soul throughout the remainder of the day. \u2022 AL-ANON BIRTHDAY CALCULATOR - View the amount of time you've been in Al-Anon each time the app is opened \u2022 ANONYMOUS ICON - To protect anonymity, the actual app icon does not show references to Al-Anon \u2022 Available for iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad! How ANT Gives You Privacy While ANT eliminates the possibility of losing your journal, it\u2019s even better that it gives you something more priceless: privacy. As mentioned earlier, all data is encrypted and password protected. Using the same security as banks, your data is transmitted over SSL. So, go ahead, write whatever you\u2019re feeling. Whether you hate your spouse, feel attracted to someone else, tempted to slap your boss \u2026 whatever, just type in your journal without the fear of being discovered and judged.

Oh, what scandals can occur from private information! It\u2019s so good to know that both of these situations are avoidable \u2013 thanks to this SAAT App! FEATURES: JOURNALIn addition to writing our inventories and the list of people we have harmed, most of us have found that writing has been an indispensable tool for working the Steps. Further, putting our thoughts and feelings down on paper, or describing a troubling incident, helps us to better understand our actions and reactions in a way that is often not revealed to us by simply thinking or talking about them. In the past, compulsive sexual behavior was our most common reaction to life. When we put our difficulties down on paper, it becomes easier to see situations more clearly and perhaps better discern any necessary action. With the journal, you simply type in an entry. Whatever you want to express \u2013 anger, sadness, joy, etc. \u2013 do so with the assurance that your thoughts will remain private.

It\u2019s been proven that if you put aside a minute or two every day to express gratitude for your life you will feel happier, more determined, more energetic, and more optimistic. \u2014 This was proven by a series of studies conducted by Psychologists Robert Emmons and Michael McCullough. \u201cWhat you focus on expands, and when you focus on the goodness in your life, you create more of it. Opportunities, relationships, even money flowed my way when I learned to be grateful no matter what happened in my life.\u201d \u2014 Oprah Winfrey \u2022 SPOT CHECK INVENTORIES - With Spot Check Inventories, this is an opportunity to quickly express your resentment.

The application is free\u2014ideal for use by project managers, engineers, operators, mechanics, and distributors in agricultural, industrial, municipal, mining, and rental applications.  Please Note: Cornell Toolkit is used as an approximating tool for pumps and systems. While the Cornell Toolkit has been examined by Cornell staff, including professional engineers, and found to be accurate, Cornell offers more detailed and precise calculations through tools available on our website. Cornell Toolkit is a quick check for in field operations, and narrowing pump selections.Calculations are made assuming 60 degree Fahrenheit water; water at significantly different temperatures or liquids with different specific gravity may yield substantially divergent results. Piping friction loss is calculated using Hazen-Williams hydraulic equations\u2014as the diameter of pumps get smaller than 3\u201d or larger than 12\u201d there is less accuracy in the calculation that is not corrected by the toolkit.  Care should be used in comparing smaller or larger piping with the toolkit.\n"},

It has a Journal that makes it easy to find time to write in your journal. Just have access to an internet connection at home (computer) or on the go (mobile devices and tablets) and journal via typing. It also has a Spot Check Inventory that allows you to quickly get rid of resentments when on the go and you can later add more detail via your computer because all data is securely synced to the cloud using the same security as banks! Just because you're in recovery doesn't mean life will slow down. Instead it will move forward, and so must you. Often times moving forward means being on the constant go. In effect, this means that if you\u2019re using journaling as part of your recovery, then you don\u2019t have time to sit down and write your feelings out. There\u2019s another problem that arises with paper journaling: privacy. If you mistakenly leave your journal out, someone might \u201caccidentally\u201d read it. Although a journal is a private matter and it\u2019s likely closed, people nowadays will still somehow invite themselves to opening your journal; thus, reading your private thoughts. Oh, what scandals can occur from private information! It\u2019s so good to know that both of these situations are avoidable \u2013 thanks to this GAT App! FEATURES: Recovery Journal In addition to writing our inventories and the list of people we have harmed, most of us have found that writing has been an indispensable tool for working the Steps. Further, putting our thoughts and feelings down on paper, or describing a troubling incident, helps us to better understand our actions and reactions in a way that is often not revealed to us by simply thinking or talking about them. In the past, gambling was our most common reaction to life. When we put our difficulties down on paper, it becomes easier to see situations more clearly and perhaps better discern any necessary action. With the journal, you simply type in an entry. Whatever you want to express \u2013 anger, sadness, joy, etc. \u2013 do so with the assurance that your thoughts will remain private. This is because all data is encrypted; you\u2019re the only person who will have access to it. If you want to add an extra sense of security for your own peace of mind, create a fictitious name. Remember, however, that you\u2019re the only writer and reader in GAT\u2019s journal. In addition, you can edit and delete entries at any time. \u2022 GRATITUDE LIST If you create a Gratitude List using My GA Toolkit on a daily or weekly basis it will help you abstain from Gambling! It\u2019s been proven that if you put aside a minute or two every day to express gratitude for your life you will feel happier, more determined, more energetic, and more optimistic. \u2014 This was proven by a series of studies conducted by Psychologists Robert Emmons and Michael McCullough. \u201cWhat you focus on expands, and when you focus on the goodness in your life, you create more of it. Opportunities, relationships, even money flowed my way when I learned to be grateful no matter what happened in my life.\u201d \u2014 Oprah Winfrey \u2022 SPOT CHECK INVENTORIES - With Spot Check Inventories, this is an opportunity to quickly express your resentment. When you\u2019re angry, you need to dispose this emotion fast so that it won\u2019t eat at your soul throughout the remainder of the day. \u2022 GA ABSTINENCE BIRTHDAY CALCULATOR - View the amount of time you\u2019ve been abstinent from Gambling each time the app is opened. \u2022 ANONYMOUS ICON - To protect anonymity, the actual app icon does not show references to Gamblers Anonymous.

This means that two monsters of the same species can have up to 20% different maximal CP. Calcy IV helps you to decide in under a second whether a monster is worth leveling up or can be transferred immediately.On startup, Calcy displays an unobtrusive and movable overlay button. By tapping this button once while in a monster screen, the app automatically calculates this monsters IVs. For fully evolved monsters, Calcy also calculates the DPS and the performance of your attackmoves when used either as an attacker or a defender.By tapping the button while your teamleader gives his appraisal, you can read in the additional appraisal information to refine the result of Calcy.By tapping the overlay button a longer time, you can insert the moves and the appraisal information manually. You can switch to the app to see all your scans, check how much it costs to level up the monster to a selectable level and what stats it has at this level, check all possible IV-combination, analyze the scanned attackmoves, their performance, their type effectiveness, and compare them to other moves, and fully customize Calcy to your personal preferences.By tapping the button in a gym screen, Calcy shows you the defenders weaknesses and possible moves and tells you how to counter it with the best of your monsters either by pure damage or by damage together with durability. This is also usable against raid bosses.If you wish, Calcy generates a nickname (based out of adjustable blocks containing e.g. IV-Performances or combinations, move types, DPS and whether the monster is an attacker or defender.) and copies it to the clipboard from where you can insert it easily in the game.There is no need to insert the monster values manually. The app uses a screenshot and optimized text-recognition to read the needed values. Both the scan and the output of Calcy doesn't interfere with the game. Calcy uses the arc above the monster to get the exact monster level. This means you get the most precise IVs possible - and not just an average.\n"},

This paired with haptic feedback make this the ultimate ruler app on the play store.  Other ruler apps are restricted to the height of the screen, and therefore are not nearly as versatile.PROTRACTOR:- Gyro Measure:  Using the phone&apos;s gyroscope data, this app is capable of obtaining angle measurements in a totally new, unique, intuitive, and powerful way.  Additionally, using relative angle detection, this protractor is the most accurate currently on the market.  Other protractor apps rely on the device&apos;s gravity sensors, and and as a result can only work when the phone is upright, and work less accurately.BALANCE:-Real Time Gyro Balance:  Unlike other balance apps which utilize a relative position algorithm for their balance, this app converts gyro data real time into a more accurate and visually effective balance.  What this means is an incredibly quick response time, and more accurate data than even a physical leveler can offer.  Other leveler apps use the slow and inaccurate relative positioning method to determine whether the surface is level, and displays the levelness in vague terms.  This leads to a visually confusing, inaccurate, and slowly responsive levelerThese unique features and more are available in Toolkit Plus, making it the last ruler, protractor, and leveler that you will ever need!KNOWN BUG:On devices running android 4.4, Side Menus fail to open, leaving the user stranded at the greeting page.

De toolkit prikkelt jou om na te denken over hoe je je netwerk kunt gebruiken om beter te worden als leraar. Netwerkleren als professionaliseringsvorm! Je krijgt handvatten voor het opstarten van netwerkleren binnen jouw school of tussen scholen. Ook helpt het bij het versterken of verbreden van bestaande leernetwerken. De toolkit stimuleert hiermee om vanuit een oplossingsgerichte houding praktijkvraagstukken met elkaar op te pakken. Door de vele actieve werkvormen te gebruiken ontwikkel je een netwerk met meerwaarde! Hoe werkt deze app?De app bevat kaarten met informatie, werkvormen, reflectietools en verhalen van andere leraren over netwerkleren. Je kunt op drie manieren de kaarten gebruiken. Je start bijvoorbeeld vanuit een bepaalde praktijkvraag. De app toont voor iedere praktijkvraag een aantal kaarten uit de toolkit die kunnen helpen bij de oplossing. Je kunt ook zoeken op trefwoorden, het gehele overzicht van de kaarten bekijken en kaarten toevoegen aan jouw favorieten. Tools en inspiratieDe toolkit bevat diverse activiteiten die u kunt inzetten om een leernetwerk te starten of uit te breiden. De activiteit Wereldcaf\u00e9 laat bijvoorbeeld kleine of grote groepen leraren op een krachtige manier ervaren hoe je kennis en ervaringen deelt. Met de reflectietools kunt u voor uzelf of enkele collega&apos;s een klein onderzoekje starten. Zo kunt u met de Quiz op een gezellige manier erachter komen of netwerkleren past bij jou en jouw collega&apos;s. En lees ook eens de inspiratieverhalen: veel leraren gingen je voor met netwerkleren, en hun ervaringen delen zij graag met jou! Deel kennis met collega\u2019sEen interessante kaart gevonden? Deel deze dan via Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter of via de mail. Ook kun je een uitnodiging sturen aan een collega om samen een activiteit uit te voeren.

It was a school project of a few art students, and to a surprise for the creators it attracted lots of visitors for years to come. In 2012 Thisissand was developed into an app and is still run by one of the original creators.Thisissand offers different kinds of tools for choosing the sand color. Originally and still at the moment on the website, only the essential Color Palette tool is available. For the app, we have developed a few special kinds of tools which are available as the Toolkit in-app purchase. Just like on the website, the special tools are not at all necessary to enjoy the app, but we're happy and thankful for your support if you're willing to try them out!COLOR PALETTE: Use Color Palette to choose specific colors from a vast swatch of colors. You may choose a solid color, or multiple colors to variate between. Use the intensity slider to adjust how fast the colors change. You may also use the randomize button to get surprising color combos.COLOR SHIFTER: Color Shifter continuously changes the sand color subtly or dramatically depending on the intensity slider adjustment. Color Shifter often produces rainbow like hues. To set the initial Color Shifter color, choose a color with Color Palette and then select the Color Shifter tool.COLOR PICKER: With Color Picker, you may pick the sand color from around you using your device camera. It takes a little practice to point your camera and draw at the same time, but in return you get truly unique colors. Try adjusting the color change intensity low in the beginning to keep things under control!PHOTO SAND: Want to try making a sand version of one of your photos? Photo Sand picks the sand color directly from the photo you've chosen from your camera roll. Try it out and learn the tricks to make abstract and/or photorealistic representations!MY COLORS: Save your favorite colors in My Colors and access them quickly by long pressing the color button on the sand canvas. Try saving colors from around with Color Picker!- - - - - - - - - -We highly value your feedback and questions.

Developers are able to use the innovative smartBASIC language to programme the module for a wide variety of sensor applications in less than a day, significantly reducing overall time to market.This app includes a heart rate monitor, blood pressure monitor, temperature sensor and a proximity sensor. The BL600 provides for a wide array of potential applications beyond just these four applications. This app is fully compatible with other Bluetooth Smart Ready devices which utilise these profiles.Note:- Tested on Nexus 4 and Nexus 7 with Android 4.4Known Issues:- if the Android device gets out of range then on re-connection it will not be able to re-enable notifications/indications. restarting the BLE module seems to fix the problem- Resetting Bluetooth and/or the BLE module might be required If you have any problems connecting/reconnecting or writing/reading attributes\n"},

The Player Card also publishes the latest news regarding the player, including news regarding player injuries.4.  Synergy Assist - provides recommendations for the user\u2019s specific team rosters.  Once the user has pre-selected one or several players, and needs help completing their lineup, Synergy Assist will complete the lineup with the additional players that, when combined with the players that were pre-selected by the user, will produce a lineup that maximizes the projected fantasy points within the salary cap and fantasy game requirements.

This application provides even the newest Android user with a simple method to check their device for root (administrator, superuser, or su) access. The application provides a very simple user interface that easily notifies the user whether or not they have properly setup root (superuser) access.*Feel free to email me with any questions. I always reply!*This application will test the device for root (superuser) access using a very simple, quick, and reliable method that has been successful for over 10 million Android devices. The su binary is the most common binary used on Android devices to grant and manage root (superuser) access. Root Checker will check and verify that the su binary is located in a standard location on the device. In addition, Root Checker will verify that the su binary is properly functioning in granting root (superuser) access.Many times users experience issues along the path of installing, configuring, and gaining root access. For some users the process can seem complex while for others the process can seem simple. Regardless of the user's technical skill set, Root Checker, will quickly and correctly verify whether or not root access is 100% functioning. The process of confirming root access is sometimes known by other terms such as, gaining superuser access or gaining administrator access. Root Checker covers all these terms as they relate to one core function, being able to execute commands through the su binary with root access.If the Superuser management applications (SuperSU, Superuser, etc.) are installed and working properly, these applications will prompt the user to accept or deny the root access request from Root Checker. Accepting the request will allow Root Checker to check for and confirm root access. Denying the request will result in Root Checker reporting no root access.Please don't leave negative feedback about a concern, bug or issue!

L-system fractals are a type of fractal in which a parallel rewriting system is used to generate a fractal image. In an L-system, a simple grammar is used to recursively define a structure that contains self-similarity, such as a plant in which each of the plant&apos;s branches are miniatures of the larger plant. Aristid Lindenmayer, a Hungarian biologist, developed the L-system as a way to provide a formal description of the growth pattern of simple organisms. L-systems can be used to define drawings that look like plants, snowflakes, and other fractal patterns in which subsets of the structure are similar to the larger structure.  This program includes several examples that you can edit using L-System parameters.  A help page is included in the application.\n"},

Detsy and his team, in 1987,\u00a0published the first report of a\u00a0nutritional assessment tool, entitled SGA, that\u00a0uses clinical judgment to assess nutritional status\u00a0in preoperative surgical patients and to predict\u00a0postoperative infections; SGA had the best sensitivity\u00a0and specificity for predicting infection after\u00a0surgery.The\u00a0original SGA form had clinicians score 5 components of a\u00a0medical history (i.e., weight change, dietary intake,\u00a0gastrointestinal symptoms, functional capacity,\u00a0disease and its relation to nutritional requirements)\u00a0and 3 components of a brief physical\u00a0examination (ie, signs of fat and muscle wasting,\u00a0nutrition-associated alternations in fluid balance).\u00a0The patient is then assigned a rating of Well\u00a0nourished (A), moderately undernourished (B),\u00a0or Severely undernourished (C) by subjective consideration of the data collected in the 8 areas,\u00a0without adhering to a rigid scoring system. The SGA Toolkit developed by IAPEN also contains 7-point scale SGA. References:\u00a01. Detsky, A. S., Baker, J. P., Johnston, N., Whittaker, S., Mendelson, R. A., & Jeejeebhoy, K. N. (1987).

The other colors will be converted to gray scale. Specially useful for images with color captions.3) Simulation tool - Allows the user to simulate how the image would be seen by someone who has deuteranopia or protanopia.All the tools can be applied to either images chosen from the gallery or taken from the camera.

You can use My OA Toolkit's Food Journal as a your Plan of Eating Tool for the day or as a way to log your food throughout your day and turn your food over to your sponsor at the end of the day... You can also use your OAT Food Journal if you become irritable, restless, or discontent throughout your day to get those feelings out of your head and in your journal. It can be like having a sponsor in your pocket and keep you from compulsive overeating! Personally I use My OA Toolkit Journal to enter everything I eat throughout the day.  Then at the end of the day I turn my food over to my OA Sponsor by emailing them my Food Journal for that day directly from within My OA Toolkit. What\u2019s great about this is that I can see my days past entries and Identify patterns in my eating habits and see why I may have overeaten on a certain day... It also has an Abstinence Date Calculator that will help you track how long you've abstained from Overeating by total hours, days, months, and years.FEATURES: \u2022 Food Journal / Diary In addition to writing our inventories and the list of people we have harmed, most of us have found that writing has been an indispensable tool for working the Steps. Further, putting our thoughts and feelings down on paper, or describing a troubling incident, helps us to better understand our actions and reactions in a way that is often not revealed to us by simply thinking or talking about them. In the past, compulsive eating was our most common reaction to life. When we put our difficulties down on paper, it becomes easier to see situations more clearly and perhaps better discern any necessary action.You could also use your journal to create your plan of eating.As a tool, a plan of eating helps us to abstain from eating compulsively. Having a personal plan of eating guides us in our dietary decisions, as well as defines what, when, how, where and why we eat. It is our experience that sharing this plan with a sponsor or another OA member is important.There are no specific requirements for a plan of eating; OA does not endorse or recommend any specific plan of eating, nor does it exclude the personal use of one. (See the pamphlets Dignity of Choice and A Plan of Eating for more information.) For specific dietary or nutritional guidance, OA suggests consulting a qualified health care professional, such as a physician or dietician. Each of us develops a personal plan of eating based on an honest appraisal of his or her own past experience; we also have come to identify our current individual needs, as well as those things which we should avoid.Although individual plans of eating are as varied as our members, most OA members agree that some plan \u2014 no matter how flexible or structured \u2014 is necessary.This tool helps us deal with the physical aspects of our disease and helps us achieve physical recovery. From this vantage point, we can more effectively follow OA's Twelve-Step program of recovery and move beyond the food to a happier, healthier and more spiritual living experience.Source:  http://www.oalaig.org/about-oa/the-eight-tools-of-oa.html\u2022 Gratitude List If you create a Gratitude List using My OA Toolkit on a daily or weekly basis it will help you abstain from compulsive overeating!  It's been proven that if you put aside a minute or two every day to express gratitude for your life you will feel happier, more determined, more energetic, and more optimistic.  \u2014 This was proven by a series of studies conducted by Psychologists Robert Emmons and Michael McCullough.\"What you focus on expands, and when you focus on the goodness in your life, you create more of it. Opportunities, relationships, even money flowed my way when I learned to be grateful no matter what happened in my life.\" \u2014 Oprah Winfrey\n"},
