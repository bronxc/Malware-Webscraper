Peer is the performance app for today\u2019s workforce.Peer replaces cumbersome annual performance reviews with continuous, lightweight peer feedback.  Peers are prompted to leave feedback after real-world interactions, making feedback fresh, frequent, and relevant.Peer gets everyone more feedback through its unique \u201cgive-to-get\u201d model. This asks people to leave feedback to view what others have said about them.  Everyone participates and the entire team gets more feedback.Leaving feedback in Peer is fast and easy, literally taking seconds versus hours like traditional reviews. And as a mobile app, Peer enables users to leave feedback right when they have it, versus forgetting about it on the way from the meeting back to their desk.All Peer feedback is aggregated so that users can see trends and how peers view their performance over time. Real-time data means there aren\u2019t the end of year surprises that often occur with annual reviews.Free for unlimited evaluation, Peer is the first performance app accessible to companies of all sizes.  This includes both established companies looking to replace existing performance reviews as well as small companies that have found traditional systems too cumbersome to deploy.Peer is now available for private beta. If your company isn\u2019t on the list of Peer-enabled organizations, join the waitlist and we\u2019ll notify you.\n"},

Secure Call prevents stealing your conversation by 3rd parties -even including application developers- thanks to it's P2P architecture with end-to-end high encryption technology.ENCRYPTED VOICE CALLS IN HD QUALITYSecure Call can provide crystal-clear, encrypted voice calls even with 2G connections.FULL ANONYMITYSecure Call does not require your personal information such that your phone number, your e-mail address or any kind of your membership. In this way, it becomes impossible to determine user's true identity. You can make encrypted secure voice calls by completely remaining anonymous thanks to one-time generated Secure Call number that is generated during application installation.HIGH ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGYSecure Call provides a secure way that all user calls are performed directly between users thanks to peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture and military grade encryption. Secure Call has no fixed encryption key and all encryption keys generated automatically for each calls. Asymmetric key exchange mechanism is used to exchange encryption keys between only relevant call participants.PEER-TO-PEER (P2P) COMMUNICATIONOther communication services usually operates with client-server architecture that requires each user has to send it's communication data to one of service servers, and that server is responsible to relay communication data to other party. Due to this model, other service providers could backup, process and even sell your communication data to third parties without even you notice that. To protect the privacy of your communication data, Secure Call service servers only bring caller and callee together. After that, all communication data are exchanged directly between caller and callee with encryption and encryption keys are known only by relevant participants. Thus no one -even including the engineers who developed Secure Call- could listen your conversation data.MINIMAL APP PERMISSIONSUnlike other communication applications, Secure Call does not need to access your sensitive information (phone number, IMEI number, location information, photos, contacts, SMS sending/receive etc.) that can be used to reveal your true identity. Secure Call is only a voice calling application and needs minimal app permissions to operate. Secure Call needs notifications to receive calls, microphone and internet access to transfer your voice.INNOVATIVE PHONE NUMBERING SYSTEMSecure Call users in every corner of the world, unlike complicated phone numbering systems, can perform encrypted voice calling by dialing fewer numbers through innovative numbering system.EASY TO USE USER-FRIENDLY INTERFACEInstead of complicated user interfaces, hard questions, never ending registration processes, you can simply install Secure Call application and immediately make encrypted voice calls with accustomed user interfaces.FULL INDEPENDENT COMPANYImplementing and operating communication technologies requires high costs. It's very natural to questionate free messaging and voice call services for possibility of generating revenue from the user data. All the costs of services which we provide to you are covered by user subscriptions. Our company gets all power from it's user base and has no affilities with any kind of governments or organizations. 24/7 SUPPORTAll questions and suggestions of our users are responded by our technical support team through 24/7.\n"},

For example with Samsung TVs DLNA once selected if the contents of the folder is empty, press the \"Back\" until the server selection menu and reselect MediaServer.\nMedia Server for Android official Trailer\n\n\n\n"},

If a stream is offline or a server is busy then there is nothing that this app can do.Notes:- At this time Sop to Http is not supported on devices using x86 or MIPS CPU.- Sopcast servers may have user limit and in the rare situations when this limit is reached, you will not be able to connect to server and you will receive the same message as when the stream is offline. This happens also on any other type of sopcast client.Requirements:-Fast internet connection (Ethernet the best, WiFi or LTE recommended, 4G may work).-Good and stable data signal.-10 MB free internal memory space.-A good quality stream (The app will attempt to open any stream regardless of its quality, stability or how good it is).-A good and compatible video player. (If you get an error saying something like \"this stream can't be played\" then you should try a different video player)Functionality:Sop to Http will create a local http:// stream that can be played with your favorite video player.Features:-Add support for sop:// links to your device.-You can use your favorite video player.-You can use a video player that support aspect ratio stretching.-Some streams have the audio out of sync. You can use a player that is able to fix this problem.-Works with links. Just click on a sop:// link and the application will do the rest for you.-Safe auto-stop. In case that there is no video player currently running, the streaming will stop by itself.The streaming is done using a p2p network. This means that the stability of the stream is influenced by how many peers(people visualizing the stream) are at the same time. The more, the better.The number of peers changes every second and when they are not sufficient, you will miss receiving one or more packets. This, depending of the video player you are using, may have various results like: freezing, stopping or even crashing some video players. This is not a bug in this app or servers or network. The bug is in the video player because it can't handle p2p streams and if you would like to have this fixed you should contact the developer of the video player you are using.\n"},

Fortunately, there is an entirely new way of dealing with torrent video downloads and that is by using Free Torrent Video Player. Torrents have become one of the most popular ways to share and download content, including video files and other multimedia files. Torrents generally offer high speeds as well, particularly in cases where you have more seeders than peers. When you are choosing which torrent to download, you should always go for the one which has the best ratio between seeders and peers due to the fact that the seeders already have the complete video file on their computer for downloading. Peers, by contrast, only have part of the file available. However, even with a good seeders to peers ratio, torrents can still take a long time to download. Watch InstantlyFree Torrent Video Player completely revolutionizes your torrent video downloading experience. Traditional torrent clients generally only let you download torrents without providing any functionality allowing you to preview it, let alone watch the movie as it is downloading. Torrent Video Player, on the other hand, works just like your favorite media player thanks to its familiar and intuitive features. No longer do you have to wait for the entire torrent to download before you can start watching the video content contained within it. It is rather like watching a streaming video over a video-sharing website. The interface is easy to use and it is based on the immensely popular and highly versatile media player. Torrent Video Player will truly change the way you watch your movies!Easy to useSome of the mainstream torrent clients do provide a basic preview feature which allows you to watch at least a small part of the video before the whole thing is downloaded, but these features often lack reliability and are often difficult to use. Traditional torrent clients also download files in a different way to how Torrent Video Player does. They do not download the file contiguously, making it impossible to actually watch the video from the start before it has finished downloading. Torrent Video Player will download the file in the correct way however so that you don't have to wait.Completely free!If you want to be able to enjoy torrent videos without the annoying restrictions imposed by the traditional torrent clients, then Torrent Video Player is precisely the answer that you should be looking for. Best of all, the program is completely free! Now you will be able to download and play at the same time, allowing you to watch any movie at any time!\n"},

This means that any other computer/device can access the files on your android device while the ftp server is running. For example, entering 'ftp://...' in the firefox url bar will allow you to browse the files on your device from a desktop pc or a laptop.By default, the user name and password are both 'ftp', you should change them. You use this user name and password when accessing the server.For power and security reasons, it is recommended that the server be stopped after use.Features:* Complete and efficient FTP Server* Implements advanced FTP features like UTF8, MDTM and MFMT* Implements Bonjour/DNS-SD for easy service discovery* Can automatically connect on selected wifi networks (work/home/...)* Can be started/stopped by Tasker or Locale, is thus also a Tasker/Locale plug-in* Anonymous login possible (with restricted rights for security)* Configuration of chroot directory possible (default sdcard)* Configuration of port possible (default 2121)* Possible to keep running while screen off* Runs on local network, even when tethering (phone is the access point)* Has public intents to support scripting:  - be.ppareit.swiftp.ACTION_START_FTPSERVER  - be.ppareit.swiftp.ACTION_STOP_FTPSERVER* Follows Material interface guidelines, looks good on phone/tablet/tv/...* Uses notification to remind user that the server is running* Easy starting/stopping server from settings* Has widget to ease starting/stopping serverThe server is completely implemented in the app itself, it does not use an external library. It provides the best possible performance on android to run. Some advanced features like UTF8, MDTM and MFMT are implemented. Though the underlying file system must support them.The Bonjour/DNS-SD support is very handy if the client os and it's file manager also supports the protocols. In this way, the moment you start the ftp server on the android device, you will find it on the network folder of your desktop.A lot of users asked if it was possible to automatically start the server when the android device was running. We found that it was more useful to automatically start the server when we are connected to certain wifi networks. This has the same effect and is very handy, for instance when you arrive home, start your ftp server. We then went even further and we added support for Tasker or Locale. The people who like to script some use case for there device can thus easily do that.Logical settings are available, like you can for instance set anonymous login and configure chroot and port. A minor group of users have some special use cases. For instance running the server while tethering or running the server from the ethernet cable. All those are possible and we are open for more improvements.The design follows the official guidelines. You can be sure that the interface and the logo's look good on your device. We also make it easy to control the server, using notifications or widgets where needed.FTP Server is open source software released under the GPL v3.Code: https://github.com/ppareit/swiftpIssues: https://github.com/ppareit/swiftp/issues?state=openCurrent maintainer: Pieter Pareit.Initial development: Dave Revell.This is the DEMO version of FTP Server.\n"},

New in the current version is capable of running/opening a file right within Search Result or Properties dialog of a directory.Despite its modern design, it is usable all the way down to 4-year old Android 1.6, in fact you can use it on any device running Android 1.6 or later all the way to newest Jelly Bean and even farther into the future. Note: I have no actual 1.6 hardware and my emulator is broken. So please inform me if it is not working for Android 1.6. My minimum testing hardware is a 2.1 phone that I almost never use otherwise. This grew out a very simple need for myself; to copy a file from one card to another card, using one standard Android phone with one slot; surprisingly it wasn&apos;t covered by the file management apps I already have downloaded, and to my knowledge such simple tool can be written faster than finding a capable app. So that was what I did in few minutes, afterwards I expanded to a much more complex general use that you can see now. App is Ad-supported, that requires use of network, but running without network is also supported. But the real big use of network is accessing FTP server. All operations are supported, please note regular commercial FTP servers usually impose Permissions by default, unlike throw-away mobile servers.Inspired by old Windows 3.1, I added one feature that as far as I know was never seen anywhere afterwards, although I elected to not implement it to cover directories only per-file basis: copy-and-paste files in batches of multiple files.Features of this app are:- copying (multiple files under one directory).- paste (arbitrary multiple files).- delete file.- delete directories (empty or otherwise).- rename file/directory.- compressing or extracting Zips.- FTP access.- dual-pane dual page operation.- open (Run...) a file using appropriate app.- navigate all file systems (Root needs caution).- simple interface and icons for known files.- viewing text/xml/html files.- sorting the file list.If you wish for some extra feature like copying directory please sound off here in Google Play/Android Market. Please limit yourself to English or Chinese, or other Babelfish-translatable languages.\n"},

The backend uses the original KeePass libraries to handle file access to ensure file format compatibility.Main features of the App are* read/write support for .kdbx (KeePass 2.x) files* integrates with nearly every Android browser (see below)* QuickUnlock: Unlock your database once with your full password, re-open it by typing just a few characters (see below)* Access files from the cloud or the web (Dropbox, Google Drive, SkyDrive, FTP, WebDAV). You can use \"Keepass2Android Offline\" if you don't need this feature. * Integrated Soft-Keyboard: Switch to this keyboard for entering user credentials. This shields you from clipboard based password sniffers (see below)* support for editing entries including additional string fields, file attachments, tags etc.* search dialog with all search options from KeePass 2.x. Required privileges:* Access SD Card* Access Internet (required for accessing files via FTP/WebDav). Install \"Keepass2Android Offline\" if you don't want to grant this privilege.* VibrateBug reports and suggestions: http://keepass2android.codeplex.com/== Browser integration ==If you need to lookup a password for a webpage, go to Menu/Share... and select Keepass2Android. This will* bring up a screen to load/unlock a database if no database is loaded and unlocked* go to the Search Results screen displaying all entries for the currently visited URL  - or -* directly offer the Copy Username/Password notifications if exactly one entry matches the currently visited URL == QuickUnlock ==You should protect your password database with a strong (i.e. random and LONG) password including upper and lower case as well as numbers and special characters. Typing such a password on a mobile phone every time you unlock your database is time-consuming and error-prone. The KP2A solution is QuickUnlock:* Use a strong password for your database* Load your database and type the strong password once. Enable QuickUnlock.* The application is locked after the time specified in the settings* If you want to re-open your database, you can type just a few characters (by default, the last 3 characters of your password) to unlock quickly and easily!* If the wrong QuickUnlock key is entered, the database is locked and the full password is required to re-open. Is this safe? First: it allows you to use a really strong password, this increases safety in case someone gets your database file. Second: If you loose your phone and someone tries to open the password database, the attacker has exactly one chance to make use of QuickUnlock. When using 3 characters and assuming 70 characters in the set of possible characters, the attacker has a 0.0003% chance of opening the file. If this sounds still too much for you, choose 4 or more characters in the settings.QuickUnlock requires an icon in the notification area. This is because Android would kill Keepass2Android too often without this icon. It does not require battery power. == Keepass2Android Keyboard == A German research team has demonstrated that clipboard-based access of credentials as used by most Android password managers is not safe: Every app on your phone can register for changes of the clipboard and thus be notified when you copy your passwords from the password manager to your clipboard. In order to protect against this kind of attack, you should use the Keepass2Android keyboard: When you select an entry, a notification will appear in the notification bar. This notification lets you switch to the KP2A keyboard. ON this keyboard, click the KP2A symbol to \"type\" your credentials. Click the keyboard key to switch back to your favorite keyboard.\nKeepass2Android Password Safe for Android official Trailer\n\n\n\n"},

I check for that. The host can be an IP address or a domain name.The scale factor is the factor by which the camera image is reduced prior to saving on your phone / uploading.

Check your phone's settings for \"optimizations\" that might block apps from running on startup. Try making the BSR app \"protected\".Problem: Very bad sound quality even on highest settingsSolution: Make sure that your microphone is not obscured. Check if a leather or plastic casing of the phone obscures any of its microphones. Record a short audio speaking or knocking to different parts of your phone to find out where the most sensitive microphones are located. If the mic is on the bottom, put the phone up side down in the pocket so that the mic sticks out. Try an external microphone. Try a different phone, more expensive phones tend to have better microphones.\n"},

It reads and writes .kdbx-files, the database format used by the popular KeePass 2.x Password Safe for Windows and other desktop operating systems.The user interface is based on Keepassdroid (by Brian Pellin), ported from Java to Mono for Android. The backend uses the original KeePass libraries to handle file access to ensure file format compatibility.Main features of the App are* read/write support for .kdbx (KeePass 2.x) files* integrates with nearly every Android browser (see below)* QuickUnlock: Unlock your database once with your full password, re-open it by typing just a few characters (see below)* Integrated Soft-Keyboard: Switch to this keyboard for entering user credentials. This shields you from clipboard based password sniffers (see below)* support for editing entries including additional string fields, file attachments, tags etc.* Note: please install Keepass2Android (non offline version) if you want to open files directly from a webserver (FTP/WebDAV).* search dialog with all search options from KeePass 2.x. Required privileges:* Access SD Card* VibrateBug reports and suggestions: http://keepass2android.codeplex.com/== Browser integration ==If you need to lookup a password for a webpage, go to Menu/Share... and select Keepass2Android. This will* bring up a screen to load/unlock a database if no database is loaded and unlocked* go to the Search Results screen displaying all entries for the currently visited URL  - or -* directly offer the Copy Username/Password notifications if exactly one entry matches the currently visited URL == QuickUnlock ==You should protect your password database with a strong (i.e. random and LONG) password including upper and lower case as well as numbers and special characters. Typing such a password on a mobile phone every time you unlock your database is time-consuming and error-prone. The KP2A solution is QuickUnlock:* Use a strong password for your database* Load your database and type the strong password once. Enable QuickUnlock.* The application is locked after the time specified in the settings* If you want to re-open your database, you can type just a few characters (by default, the last 3 characters of your password) to unlock quickly and easily!* If the wrong QuickUnlock key is entered, the database is locked and the full password is required to re-open. Is this safe? First: it allows you to use a really strong password, this increases safety in case someone gets your database file. Second: If you loose your phone and someone tries to open the password database, the attacker has exactly one chance to make use of QuickUnlock. When using 3 characters and assuming 70 characters in the set of possible characters, the attacker has a 0.0003% chance of opening the file. If this sounds still too much for you, choose 4 or more characters in the settings.QuickUnlock requires an icon in the notification area. This is because Android would kill Keepass2Android too often without this icon. It does not require battery power. == Keepass2Android Keyboard == A German research team has demonstrated that clipboard-based access of credentials as used by most Android password managers is not safe: Every app on your phone can register for changes of the clipboard and thus be notified when you copy your passwords from the password manager to your clipboard. In order to protect against this kind of attack, you should use the Keepass2Android keyboard: When you select an entry, a notification will appear in the notification bar. This notification lets you switch to the KP2A keyboard. ON this keyboard, click the KP2A symbol to \"type\" your credentials. Click the keyboard key to switch back to your favorite keyboard.\n"},

You can now share your cell phone's Internet connection with your computers or tablets through either USB, Bluetooth or even WiFi Hotspot on some phone models. Most importantly it does not require the extra tether plan (mobile hotspot plan) from your carrier. Also NO ROOTING NEEDED for your Android phone.Free edition will have timed usage limit, otherwise it is same as full version.Sprint and AT&T may not allow you to install our app from Play Store, please install the apk file directly from http://pdanet.co/android, or install on the computer side from http://pdanet.co/a======WiFi Mode==========Due to lockdowns through each phone system update, WiFi mode will only be allowed on a short list of compatible devices. As of 11/2016, IN GENERAL: ---Android 7.0 (Nougat) or later no longer allows WiFi mode even for Verizon phones.   ---Verizon Samsung phones (S3/4/5/6/7/Edge, Note 2/3/4/5 etc.) , Verizon LG phones (V10, G2/3/4/5 etc.) and Verizon Sony phones (Z2/Z3) are supported by Android versions up to Android 6.0/6.1.   ---Verizon HTC phones (M7/8) will only work on Android 4.1 ~ 4.4. ---Verizon Motorola phones will only work on Android 4.3 or below. ---AT&T Samsung phones will only work on Android 4.2 or below. ---Other carriers/phones will only work if they still have Android 4.0 or below. ---Straight Talk phones will only work if it uses Verizon and are compatible with the above.  ---For all other phones, use USB mode or Bluetooth mode instead. *To get around lockdowns on WiFi mode FoxFi may prompt you to install a certificate on your phone, this will cause the Android system to enforce a screen lock and show a security message in notification. For more detail and steps to remove screen lock please visit http://pdanet.co/wifi. *If you receive a message asking for a \"password for credential strorage\" this is due to a bug in the Android system. Please see steps to clear this message at http://pdanet.co/wifi======USB Mode=========USB mode works on almost all Android phones. It allows connection from Windows PC or Mac. In addition, PdaNet comes with a \"WiFi Share\" feature that can further turn the Windows PC into a WiFi Hotspot so that you can connect other devices to it and share your phone's Internet connection.*T-Mobile or MetroPCS users can only use USB mode with \"Hide Tether Usage\" enabled in PdaNet.*If your phone is not recognized by your computer after connecting USB, please see http://pdanet.co/driver*Please treat Windows tablets (non RT) the same as Windows PC.======Bluetooth Mode======Bluetooth mode allows connection from Windows (PC) or Android tablets (excludes Android 4.4) or devices that supports Bluetooth DUN.*A system bug in Android 4.4 for tablets will break Bluetooth mode, this is fixed in Android 5.0 or later.*For Android tablets it is possible only the browser app will work in Bluetooth mode. That is because other apps may be looking for wifi or cell phone connection and not recognize the Bluetooth Internet. *One way around the above two issues is to find a wifi hotspot to connect the tablet to at the same time (such wifi hotspot does not need to provide Internet access).\n"},

When you open your app you will see the Shared tab which contains all of the files that are shared by everyone and here you can download and comment (everyone can view your comments) on each file.    2.In the File Selector tab you can select any file or folder that you want to share and once you make your choice the app will automatically share the files that you have chosen.    3.The My Files tab lets you manage your current shared files so you can remove, comment or set the privacy of you shared files.    4.The My downloads tab allows you to open or delete the files that you downloaded.    5.To use your personal website you just type the address that the application gave you in your Internet browser and there you can download your own files or files shared by others.   6. In the case on a not exsisting Wi-Fi connection the app will automatically use the device Bluetooth (it it is available )Why Share it?   1. An easy and a very fast way to share files and folder.   2. The ability to download files from everyone and upload files to everyone.   3. The ability to comment on each and every file that is shared.   4. The ability to share files with your computer by using the address given by your app.   5. The ability to use Bluetooth sharing in the case of existing Wi-Fi connection.Please in case of any difficulties you are more than welcome to send us a mail to:[email\u00a0protected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */ and we will contact as soon as possible.Thank you\n"},

So why not Share directly to a second device like your Android TV?1) Install Air-Share on 2 devices2) Pair the devices3) Share something from your favourite App via Air-Share to the second device** Some VPN apps cause Pairing issues. Disabling the VPN may help Air-Share to function.**Air-Share & Air-Launch were created to extend the Share & Launch features for all Android apps to share intents or launch intents between devices.It's more than a File Transfer app; but it's no Cloud service; there is a tiny web server running inside the Air-Share app. The shared data never leaves your home network.It allows sharing almost anything from, any app with a Share button, including large data streams.Air-Share will use your WiFi or Ethernet network, it is not recommended for use on Mobile data networks.It can share items that Chromecast cannot. It can queue your media links on Android TV as recommendations or notifications for later viewing. You can also share from PC/Mac/iPad to Android via your browser.The app is great for sharing between family members. Share with Amazon Kindle/Fire devices, Android HDMI sticks and older Google TVs.Air-Share also includes Air-Launch which is designed to launch apps remotely and side-load APKs on devices like Android TV using your phone or tablet. Air-Launch is part of the Air-Share App but appears as a separate app icon for convenience.App Launching: Open the Air-Launch app icon and choose a device and an app to launch.APK Side-loading: Long-press an app name in Air-Launch to download the APK from the remote device.For non-android users, generate unique browser URLs for PC/Mac/iPad to share to your Android TV.Your files stay on your local network. Transferred files are saved in your Downloads directory. It is your responsibility to delete them.- share apps (APK files)- share YouTube, Vimeo videos- share links from your Facebook, G+ or RSS feeds- transfer photos and videos from your Gallery apps- share web-links, magnet urls, etc- share cut & paste buffers between devices (long-press places text into remote device paste buffer)- share files and office documents from your favourite file explorer (tested with Astro and ES Explorer)- transfer and play instantly, music and movie files (mp3, mp4, etc), or queue as notifications to enjoy later- share location , GPS coordinates, KML files, Google Tracks- share contacts, people, vCards- share files and web-links from any device with an HTML-5 browser on your network.App Side-loading: You can use Air-Share in combination with \"App Backup & Restore\" (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mobi.infolife.appbackup) to side-load apps from your phone to your Android TV. Install Air-Share on both devices and pair them. Load \"App Backup & Restore\" on your phone and choose which app to share. Choose Share with other Apps, then Air-Share as the share destination. On the Air-Share screen choose your Android TV as the destination. (You must change your settings to allow loading apps from outside the play store.) As there is no Web Browser shipped on the Nexus Player, you may want to side-load one in addition to apps like QuickPic (Jpeg viewer). When side-loading from your phone keep in mind that the Nexus Player is an x86 device while your phone is likely ARM based, so native apps may have issues.App Developers:You can leverage Air-Share inside your own app using simple Android Intents to share content between paired devices.See sample code: https://github.com/BlackSpruce/Air-ShareAPIDemoYou can also use \"cURL\" to script VIEW and SEND intents from other OS's:e.g.  >>curl -v -X POST -H \"Content-Type: multipart/form-data\" -F intent-info={\\\"type\\\":\\\"image/*\\\",\\\"data\\\":\\\"myphoto.jpg\\\",\\\"action\\\":\\\"android.intent.action.VIEW\\\",\\\"userintent\\\":\\\"VIEW\\\"} -F file=@\"c:/Users/smith/myphoto.jpg\" http://\nAir-Share & Air-Launch for Android official Trailer\n\n\n\n"},

You can make a color note tab by long-pressing a note and selecting \"Change Tab Color\".* Simple note-taking.

All of your notes are stored on your own device.* Dictation software.  You can transcribe your thoughts quickly and easily.  You can then edit the result like you would with any note-taking app.  When you're editing the notes in the text view, you can insert speech anywhere in the text, and even undo the last speech input if it didn't turn out right.* Secure notes.  You can create safe notes that are private.  These private notes are locked with password protection.  When you lock a note it's an easy way to encrypt text from prying eyes.Requirements:* Google voice search is required for speech to text functionality to work.  Most devices come with it pre-installed.  If you don't want to use the speech recognition functions, the app is still fully functional without it.\n"},

It also supports saving tracks via KML/KMZ, allowing the user to record footprints while the app is running in the background.  Share GPS supports sending standard NMEA data over Bluetooth, USB, and TCP/IP.  For local connections with a program like Google Earth, your could turn your laptop into a big screen navigation device, basically using your mobile as an external GPS.  If you have a VPN setup, you could also do remote sharing of location data via TCP/IP over your 3G/4G or Wifi connections.  If it turns out your mobile does not support NMEA, Share GPS has a setting for creating the NMEA strings for you.Share GPS also supports sending location data via the KML file format, compatible with Google Earth. KMZ files can be shared via SCP, Google Drive, Dropbox, Local File, or using another provider on the phone (email as an example). It supports periodic sending and location updating of the file, which would support many possibilities.  Using a cloud solution with a shared folder, such as Drive or Dropbox, several users could send KMZ files periodically.  Then a PC user with Google Earth could set it up to periodically read the files for real-time updating. Mobile users could also access the KMZ files as well with Google Earth or other applications.  In addition to real-time location updating, Share GPS supports setting the location of the Placemark static, for the sending or saving of a specific location later on.Share GPS also supports KMZ track files. Tracks can be started, stopped, and cleared by the user at any time.  The application can also be setup to remember tracks between app runs and pick up where the user left off. Track connections  can be created at any time to support the saving and sending of the track data. The status screen indicates current data, such as the GPS coordinates, altitude, speed, and direction.  In addition, related to track collection, the status screen show distance traveled, distance from start (as the crow flies, useful for range measurements), and total track time.  Any of the status screen items can be copied to the clipboard by pressing the item.  Units can be changed by long pressing the item and choosing from the list of options.Share GPS contains other features as well.  The app keeps a constant notification up, which can be customized to include any of the status items, allowing for viewing on the lock screen for some mobiles.

If you&apos;re not seeing all your groups, go into the app Settings and enable \"Show Invisible Groups\" - they should then be visible.******New in v3.1 / v3.1.1!\"Force Gmail Sharing\" setting added; this is useful if default apps have meant nothing happens when you click on a group.New \"Hide/Show Group\" function on long-press menu. New \"Show Hidden Groups\" setting.Google required update to new libraries; this means only Android 4.0 (ICS) and higher is now supported.New in v3.0!\"Keyboard\" feature added! This will let you easily forward emails to a group!It allows you to input groups directly into a field (e.g. the To: field of an email you&apos;re composing), without leaving Gmail.To use this, enable the keyboard in device input settings (ignore the warning - we aren&apos;t evil, promise), and then switch to the Group Share for Gmail input device when you&apos;re in the desired field.Select a group and it will populate the field with the list of email addresses. It&apos;ll auto-switch back to your previous input method (or will prompt you to select one if you&apos;re on android 2.x or below).Clipboard support! Long press a group and select Copy to Clipboard, then Paste the email addresses wherever you wish (e.g. a To: field).******A simple example - you&apos;re out in the wilds somewhere and typing is tricky. You want to email some photos from your phone to your family.You already have a Gmail contact group set up with the relevant family email contacts.On your phone, you select the photo(s) in the gallery you wish to share with them, perform \"Share\".Choose Group Share for Gmail, and you are presented with a list of your Gmail contact groups.Select one, and Gmail is started with the appropriate contact email addresses filled in and your attachment(s) made.No trying to type email addresses one by one. A big timesaver!You can also simply run the app directly and choose a contact group to send an email to.Set an option to use Bcc: instead of To: (so recipients don&apos;t see each other&apos;s email addresses).This Free version is ad-supported. Please buy the ad-free version if you like it and want to support us.Note : if you enable \"Display contact count\" in the options, and the counts don&apos;t seem to reflect the number of contacts in a group when you view the contact list, there are two reasons this can happen.Firstly, some contacts may be \"joined\" into a single displayed contact (but are counted multiply in the list).Secondly, Facebook contacts are included in the count but aren&apos;t displayed in the list for a group (FB security restricts other apps viewing FB contacts).Permissions :READ_CONTACTS - so it can read who is in which group.WRITE_CONTACTS - so it can modify and create new groups.GET_ACCOUNTS - so it can get the list of configured gmail accounts to select from.INTERNET and ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE - required for the AdMob in-app advertising to work.\n"},

This program enables piano students to access hundreds of video / audio resources that help students accelerate and improve their piano learning process. All the videos are recorded with high definition; all the audios are produced professionally. Each selection is played by professional piano teachers with many years of teaching experience, and we are always adding new repertoire.There are a lot of piano resources like DVDs and CDs, or even you can search many related YouTube videos, why v-share?We found that when students practice piano daily, a handled device like iPad / Tablet is one of the most ideal tools. Usually when students sit in front of a piano, accessing TV or laptop is not convenient, but a handheld device can be easily put on the piano. Searching for videos on YouTube is quite time-consuming, and often most parents, with limited musical knowledge, can\u2019t judge whether the videos searched are good enough.All the videos on V-Share are 1080P. When recording, the video and audio are separated. Audio material will be merged with video after professional processing, thus ensuring the quality of video and sound. All songs are played by professional piano teachers with many years\u2019 experience.Most channels are recorded first, hands together at regular speed and then slowly, hands separately. Anyone can learn many songs even if they don\u2019t read notes. When students watch the slow speed, hands separate video; they can easily set a mark anywhere, later they can click &apos;Play from mark&apos; to play a particular music block repeatedly.\n"},

This application has a fun and non-medical purpose. It requires headphones and works like a stethoscope filtering and amplifying the sound from the microphone before the rebroadcast of the headphones. This application does not work with headset.To use it, turn on the application, plug in the headphones, launch listening and as if it were a stethoscope, affix the microphone of the device on the abdomen of pregnant mother. You can record at any time what you hear and then play it again or share it on social networks.CAUTION In order to do not expose the baby to wave from the phone (or tablet), it is important to put the device in airplane mode before you put it on your abdomen. The quality of listening depends on: -The presumed date of birth. Baby's heartbeat start to be audible after approximately 30 weeks of gestation. -The position of your baby. It is necessary to place the microphone in the back of the baby. In some positions, it is impossible to hear his heart. He just need to wait until your baby position has changed to be able to hear his heart again. -The quality of the microphone equipping your smartphone (or tablet). Following models and brands, the sound quality can range from a clear and audible beat to no beat sound at all. -Your headphones quality. Some devices badly restore low sounds like your baby's heart beat and can make listening impossible. We advise you first time to exercise you with listening your own heart. If the sound is clear and audible, you are likely to hear your baby heart beat. To maximize chances to hear your baby's heart, it is necessary to use the application in a totally silent room. For better sound quality, the application also provides user the ability to tune sound filter through parameters. This will allow you to adjust settings to your specific device characteristics. CAUTION: This application do not replace a real medical device and should no be use for medical purposes. This application provides no indication or information on the health of your baby. Functions:-Listen to the heart of your unborn baby and record it-Play and replay your recordings as much as you want-Share your best recordings as video (Facebook, Twitter, etc.)\n"},

Don\u2019t worry, we understand not everyone has\u20261.21 gigawatts!! to spend.Having said this, we\u2019ve been reading a lot about Google recommendations on abusing app options and settings, and we\u2019ve talked a lot about it. But as the ability to speak does not make us intelligent we\u2019ve made all the opposite. You know, without freedom of choice there is no creativity. The Launcher bores.You may also think \u201cI find your excess of settings disturbing\u201d and we don\u2019t blame you! It\u2019s a totally normal reaction. I guess you guys aren\u2019t ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it. In the end, the possibility of configuring it to your likeness is approximately 3720 to 1, what makes it the best launcher because maths never lie.And yeah, we have screens, \u00bfand icons? for sure, ahh and we have widgets too, what more?, I mean what else?, in fact, you can make your own. And if you prefer getting everything pre-made, use themes! Or widget and template packs! \u00bfIs your device\u2019s desktop boring? Change it again Sam. Your style, your rules, Do. Or do not, there\u2019s a setting for it, tweak it, change it, shaken, not stirred.And remember, \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as \u2018the unknown,\u2019 only options inside ADW Settings\u201d\u00bfAre you gonna miss it?*Endless Features*Most of the application have been reprogrammed and redesigned from scratch. Also we have added a lot of new features. Here are some of them:* Support for Android 7.1 launcher shortcuts (limited support on older versions down to 5.x)* Added new icons effects section. You can choose image filters and compositions. Awesome!!!* Dynamic UI coloring using wallpaper colors.* New way to manage screens. Hold down an empty area of the desktop.* New way to add widgets and shortcuts.* New way to change the wallpaper, lock/unlock the desktop or access settings. Hold down an empty area of the desktop and choose the option.* Added fast scroll app drawer style.* Added indexed fast scroll app drawer style.* Added some desktop transitions.* Added new section to configure icon badges.* Added a visual mode to configure desktop, icon appearance, folder appearance, and app drawer options.* Added option to change the top panel/widget.* Added option to change the content type of bottom panel (dock/widget).* Added new wrap folder mode to folders. This mode lets you launch the first app in the folder on tap, and show the folder contents on swipe up.* Added new fast application search in app drawer.* Improved app categories in app drawer.* Improved way to manage user gestures.* Improved way to apply internal and external themes.* Improved context menu for all desktop objects.* Added new Custom Widget object. You can add new custom widgets from widget list, import them from friends and other developers, create, edit and share your own.* Added some initial extensions for the custom widgets (time/battery)* Check out ADWExtensions pack for more extensions (weather, gmail, etc).* Added template manager. Remove, add and share templates easily.* Improved icon properties dialog.* Improved folder properties dialog.* Added backup manager in advanced settings/system. Now you can import data from other famous launchers (if you miss one, report back to us so we can include it!)* Added the possibility to set a secondary action on desktop shortcuts. Swipe up over the desktop shortcut to execute the secondary action.* Probably 2 or 200 things I\u2019m forgetting\u2026* A bunch of wibbly wobbly timey wimey stuff inside!\nADW Launcher 2 for Android official Trailer\n\n\n\n"},

Agree, many hotspots are closed  with password because at the dawn of WiFi - it was a kind of a policy to do so, just a habit. Everyone tended to protect his WiFi network, not clearly understanding its essence and principle of operation, therefore protected his WiFi network as much as possible. Those days are gone, now protecting WiFi networks in many cases (especially if it is a public place or private network) - it's more a habit from the past than necessity. Passwords from WiFi networks are distributed \"here\" and \"there\", but this process causes some inconvenience: to find someone to ask, to hear the password properly, input it correctly. To automate the distribution of passwords this program was created. This software product - a small add-on on top of the connecting to WiFi process, something, what you do every time connecting to unknown networks. Instead of the standard interface, use it and share passwords easily.It allows you to:1) Share the password from any WiFi network with other people.2) Use passwords from WiFi networks that are shared by other users of the application.Among the features:1) Getting passwords from server via either WiFi or 3g \\ GPRS channels;2) Locating WiFi networks in certain radius from your current location with phone's GPS sensor, download passwords in program's cache and use them even without Internet connection in place;3) Displaying all networks listing that you have share;4) English, Russian and Arabic interface languages;How does this work:You come to a place where there are several Wi-fi connections. Open the program and it shows you them. Networks list displays all available WiFi networks splitting them into three categories:a) white with a lock: these are the networks on which the password is not yet known for application's users, they are closed and you can't connect to them if you do not know the password. If you do know the password from the network, you enter it through the application and, accordingly, share with everyone else who uses this program.b) yellow with a lock: these are the networks for which you do not know the password, but at the same time it has been shared by someone who was in this place before you. If the password is still relevant, you can connect to the network without any problems, if no, you will be prompted to input password, and thus update it.c) green with a lock: it is just one of the networks, its is the one to which you are connected at the moment;In addition to these three major categories you can also see networks without the lock either white or yellow which means they are not locked and you can connect to them.The program works in two ways:a) when you are connected to the Internet (for example via another Wi-fi network or via GPRS)b) when you are not connected to the Internet, using passwords that were saved in the radius from the specified point on the map.This program is completely free and is designed more as a social initiative, rather than as a commercial application. Help each other to make the Internet more open.Please do not leave bad reviews\\marks just because you did not find the password from some network. Be patient, share networks themselves and one time(I believe very and very soon) by opening the application in a place with Wi-fi networks, where you have never been, you'll be pleasantly surprised.If you find a bug in the program, please, instead of leaving bad reviews\\marks, leave us a comment at: http://wi-fi-key.com/contact us and describe your problem. We promise to solve it as soon as possible.\n"},
