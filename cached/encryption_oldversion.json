"description": "What is KeePass?\rToday you need to remember many passwords. You need a password for the Windows network logon, your e-mail account, your homepage's ftp password, online passwords (like CodeProject member account), etc. etc. etc. The list is endless. Also, you should use different passwords for each account. Because if you use only one password everywhere and someone gets this password you have a problem... A serious problem. The thief would have access to your e-mail account, homepage, etc. Unimaginable.\r KeePass is a free/open-source password manager or safe which helps you to manage your passwords in a secure way. You can put all your passwords in one database, which is locked with one master key or a key-disk. So you only have to remember one single master password or insert the key-disk to unlock the whole database. The databases are encrypted using the best and most secure encryption algorithms currently known (AES and Twofish). For more information, see the features page.\r"},

It provides a large body of pre-coded solutions to common program requirements, and manages the execution of programs written specifically for the framework. The .NET Framework is a key Microsoft offering, and is intended to be used by most new applications created for the Windows platform.\r The pre-coded solutions that form the framework's class library cover a large range of programming needs in areas including: user interface, data access, database connectivity, cryptography, web application development, numeric algorithms, and network communications. The functions of the class library are used by programmers who combine them with their own code to produce applications.\r Programs written for the .NET Framework execute in a software environment that manages the program's runtime requirements. This runtime environment, which is also a part of the .NET Framework, is known as the Common Language Runtime (CLR). The CLR provides the appearance of an application virtual machine, so that programmers need not consider the capabilities of the specific CPU that will execute the program. The CLR also provides other important services such as security mechanisms, memory management, and exception handling. The class library and the CLR together compose the .NET Framework. The framework is intended to make it easier to develop computer applications and to reduce the vulnerability of applications and computers to security threats.\r First released in 2002, it is included with Windows XP SP2, Windows Server 2003 and Windows Vista, and can be installed on most older versions of Windows.\r"},

With First Defense PC Rescue, system recovery is almost immediate. What happens if you get the infamous BSoD (Blue screen of Death) and cannot open Windows? Even if Windows can not boot up, or if an application fails, complete recovery begins with a simple reboot. \r Advanced users can also use the RESCUE area as a \"sandbox\" in which to test applications or other system changes. Simply boot to the RESCUE area and try the change. When done testing, boot back to the ORIGINAL area and refresh, with the Copy/Update command, to remove the changes made to the RESCUE area.\r Once you are in the RESCUE area, you can continue to work. At the same time, you can copy the RESCUE area back to the ORIGINAL area. This will clean out any viruses, root kits, spyware, phish-ware, key loggers, etc. that caused you to abandon the ORIGINAL area. When finished, you can return to the ORIGINAL area.\r First Defense PC Rescue offers virtually uninterrupted system access and enhances productivity, as it significantly reduces the time to recover a failed system. This enables you to quickly repair system crashes, rather than spend time on rebuilding. Anchor folders such as My Documents so that the files remain persistent even when recovering to a rescue area.\r First Defense PC Rescue is engineered to protect against software failures, and enable users to quickly recover to a preconfigured rescue point."},

With FirstDefense-Rescue Workstation, system recovery is almost immediate. What happens if you get the infamous BSoD (Blue screen of Death) and cannot open Windows? Even if Windows can not boot up, or if an application fails, complete recovery begins with a simple reboot. \r Advanced users can also use the RESCUE area as a \"sandbox\" in which to test applications or other system changes. Simply boot to the RESCUE area and try the change. When done testing, boot back to the ORIGINAL area and refresh, with the Copy/Update command, to remove the changes made to the RESCUE area.\r Once you are in the RESCUE area, you can continue to work. At the same time, you can copy the RESCUE area back to the ORIGINAL area. This will clean out any viruses, root kits, spyware, phish-ware, key loggers, etc. that caused you to abandon the ORIGINAL area. When finished, you can return to the ORIGINAL area.\r FirstDefense-Rescue Workstation offers virtually uninterrupted system access and enhances productivity, as it significantly reduces the time to recover a failed system. This enables you to quickly repair system crashes, rather than spend time on rebuilding. Anchor folders such as My Documents so that the files remain persistent even when recovering to a rescue area.\r FirstDefense-Rescue Workstation is engineered to protect against software failures, and enable users to quickly recover to a preconfigured rescue point."}
