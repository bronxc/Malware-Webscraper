In Windows OS the so called \"NDIS wrapper\" (implemented in the Ndis.sys) provides a programming layer of communication between network protocols (TCP/IP) and all the underlying NDIS device drivers so that the implementation of high-level protocol components are independent of the network adapter itself. During vulnerability research from a local security perspective that was performed over several software firewall products designed for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 (R2 included), an issue during the loading and initialization of one of the OS NDIS protocol drivers was identified; specifically the 'Remote Access and Routing Driver' called wanarp.sys. This issue can be exploited through various NDIS 5.x filter intermediate drivers that provide the firewall functionality of several security related products. The resulting impact is vertical privilege escalation which allows a local attacker to execute code with kernel privileges from any account type, thus completely compromising the affected host."},

For folks in the security industry, traveling often times becomes a burden and adds a ton of cost to the customer. TAP was designed to make the deployment of these boxes super simple and create a self-healing and stable platform to deploy remote penetration testing platforms. Essentially the concept is simple, you pre-configure a brand new box and run the TAP setup file. This will install a service on Linux that will be configured the way you want. What it will do is establish a reverse SSH tunnel back to a machine thats exposed on the Internet for you. From there you can access the box locally from the server it connects back to. TAP automatically detects when an SSH connection has gone stale and will automatically rebuild it for you."},

A fourth vulnerability was found in the ActiveX component \"RegReader\", which is vulnerable to a buffer overflow and possible remote code execution. Manipulated project files can trigger a fifth vulnerability, which can allow an attacker to take over the WinCC PC.

A flaw exists in the RAS phonebook implementation: a phonebook value is not properly checked, and is susceptible to a buffer overrun. The overrun could be exploited for either of two purposes: causing a system failure, or running code on the system with LocalSystem privileges. If an attacker were able to log onto an affected server and modify a phonebook entry using specially malformed data, then made a connection using the modified phonebook entry, the specially malformed data could be run as code by the system."},

It catches ^C and kill commands to shut down cleanly by closing all open connections before exiting. Often, a remote workstation can be brought to its knees by saturating its process table via multiple invocations of sendmail. That's why port 25 (the sendmail port) is the default. If the target's process table (set when the target kernel was created) is filled, users will be unable to execute any shell commands. Many MUDs also crash when the number of sockets they have open exceeds a certain number. This program will put stress on MUDs by testing their limits. If a limit is reached, the MUD will either crash or will refuse to let new users log in. * The program is incomplete, in that it doesn't check for socket timeouts and subsequently reuse timed out sockets. That means the program can only keep a remote host / mud locked up until it exhausts its own available new sockets, or until it has reached MAX_DESCRIPTORS remote connections as set by the #define statement. * If the local machine starts issuing error messages, then the program has failed to saturate the remote host and has instead reached the limits of the local machine. Use ^C or the kill command to terminate it. If you are knowledgable about rebuilding kernels and have access to the root account, you can build a special kernel that will allow you to reach a much larger number of open sockets."},

The first implementation could only open and close cdrom tray but it quickly becomes powerful remote control system. Here is the list of actions you can perform: File system - full access: browse, create, remove directories; erase, rename, copy, upload, download files; set date/time of file. Processes and threads: browse, terminate; run programs; additionally for processes - set priority; for threads - suspend, resume. Registry - full access: browse, create, remove keys and values; set values. System: get/set system time (you can perform Y2K compliance test ;) ); shutdown/logoff/reboot/power off; query system info, query/set system parameters. Windows: get list of windows; query and set system colors; get screenshot or the shot for particular window; send messages to window. Hardware: read and write CMOS (does not work under Windows NT, we not implemented this feature yet). Keyboard: simulate keystrokes, remap, disable keys, view keyboard input (all features except keystroke simulation are not implemented under Windows NT yet) Jokes: open and close CD; turn monitor's power off and on; talk with dummy using message boxes; play wave files.
