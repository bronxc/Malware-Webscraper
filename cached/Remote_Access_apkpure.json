This makes remote desktop operations possible that would be unthinkable using other remote desktop software. Video editing, image editing, computer administration, online teamwork\u2026Secure: Remote computer control and maintenance using AnyDesk is as secure as online banking, thanks to TLS 1.2 encryption, 2048-bit RSA Key Exchange and Erlang technology.Fair: Remote PC access with AnyDesk is free for personal use. For commercial purposes, AnyDesk offers transparent licensing models without hidden costs, without compulsion to update and with all updates included.Quick guide:1. Install this app on your smartphone or tablet.2. Launch AnyDesk on the remote computer. Download the program file from our website anydesk.de to your computer and double-click to launch it. This shows you the computer\u2019s AnyDesk ID.3. Open the app on your smartphone or tablet and then enter the AnyDesk ID.What is AnyDesk?Rival products only claim to be able to guarantee smooth image transmission. But AnyDesk, the world\u2019s fastest remote desktop application, keeps this promise.Stylish independenceAnyDesk is the first remote access application powerful enough for you to be able to work on a remote PC smoothly and without becoming weary. All your home or office PC\u2019s programs, files and settings are always immediately available, without the need for annoying network configuration. And your files remain where they belong: on your own computer.Easy collaborationAchieve more together. AnyDesk is also absolutely ideal for online teamwork. Thanks to the optional ability to display two mouse cursors, it\u2019s possible to jointly work on text, pictures or different documents. Completely easily, quickly and without having to entrust your files to an online service.Relaxed remote maintenanceHelping is more fun when it\u2019s convenient. AnyDesk can do lots more than just remote administration and remote support. But that\u2019s not to say that it doesn\u2019t also shine in these areas. Thanks to its smooth operation, setting up a colleague\u2019s printer or installing a new CRM tool on all the computers in the sales department is almost automatic.Image frame rateIn local networks and with many internet connections, AnyDesk transfers images at 60 frames per second \u2013 much more than all the other remote desktop applications. The movements that AnyDesk shows on screen are therefore as smooth as possible, because nearly all PC monitors can also reproduce 60 frames per second. AnyDesk therefore enables you to work smoothly, without stuttering display.LatencyWhen working on a remote desktop, it is essential that latency is as low as possible. The lower the latency, the more quickly the PC being controlled reacts to input. Because internet connections require a certain amount of time to transmit data from one PC to another, it is especially important that AnyDesk itself doesn\u2019t cause any additional delays, as far as possible. In local networks, AnyDesk\u2019s latency is less than 16 milliseconds, and is therefore imperceptible.Data volumeWhen using a remote desktop tool over the internet, it is crucial that the bandwidth available is used as efficiently as possible. This is especially the case when working over mobile connections such as UMTS. AnyDesk\u2019s efficient use of bandwidth enables smooth working at available bandwidth of 100 kB/s and above. But even at bandwidths lower than this, AnyDesk performs significantly better than rival products.\n"},

ISPC helps you to access new messages and the missed calls from your smart phone. Internet is not needed for accessing the smart phone.How to use:-After installing the application it asks for signup. Here you have to provide Username, email address and password. Email address is taken so that your password can be sent to your email in case you forget. Password is to secure the application, i.e. only you can open the application.-Next select setting in the application and set the authorization password and unauthorization password; this is used to securely connect to your smart phone when you are accessing it remotely.-Then select the missed call service and set a keyword for that, do the same for the contact detail service. Then exit the application.Accessing Remotely:When you want to access the smart phone remotely send the authorization password to the smart phone through simple message from the remote mobile (any mobile). Then you will receive an acknowledgment via message (now you are connected to smart phone). Now you access your missed call by sending a message to the smart phone, the message format should be \u201ckey:\u201d (without cots, here key is the key word that you had set for missed call retrieval). Missed call list will be sent via message to the remote mobile. Now to access contacts send message to the smart phone, the message format should be \u201ckey:name\u201d or \u201dkey:number\u201d (without cots, here key is the keyword that you had set for contact retrieval). Contact will be sent via normal message to the remote mobile.After accessing the smart phone you should disconnect the connection between remote mobile and your smart phone, this is done by sending the unauthorization password to the smart phone by remote mobile through message.\n"},

The location of the file can be on any storage device \u2013 a server, NAS, PC or cloud. This enables storage to act an extension of your smart phone, tablet or remote PC. You don\u2019t need to build a private cloud or copy anything to a third party public cloud provider - with FileFlex you use your own storage instead.FEATURESRemote AccessIt provides you remote access to your files and folders from their source locations, no matter where you stored them. Access can be from a Windows, Mac or Linux computer; Android, iOS, BlackBerry or Windows tablet or smart phone; or any internet connected kiosk. The access to all storage is from a simple dashboard.File Sharing\u00a0It allows you to remotely share files from their source locations without having to sync, move or upload them to the cloud. The files and folders you share act like an extension of your recipient\u2019s local device. There are no storage limitations, no file size limits, no quality degradation (no compression) and no complicated IT type setup requirements for the sharing of files.Media Streaming\u00a0It allows the streaming of media files from their source locations to the user or to any contact. This allows the consumption and sharing of massive collections of home videos, movies and music by family and friends right from where they are stored. You don\u2019t need to upload to the cloud and they don\u2019t need to download \u2013 they stream from\u00a0your\u00a0storage.Remote Multi-Location File Management\u00a0FileFlex is arguably the world\u2019s best file manager app because it provides\u00a0remote file management between multiple devices. The traditional file manager include an ability to create folders, as well as cut, copy, paste, move and upload and delete files. But that is where a traditional file manager ends. It works for devices you are connected to, but not when you are remote.FileFlex enables you to use any internet connected smart phone, tablet or secondary computer to\u00a0remotely\u00a0cut, paste, copy, delete, rename, move and organize any document no matter where it is stored. You can even cut, copy and paste files\u00a0between\u00a0your various storage devices remotely. Remote Network Access\u00a0It turns networked devices into a powerful gateway into all storage. For example, with FileFlex on your server ( or NAS, or networked PC), you can use that server to access, share, stream and perform remote multi-device file management functions to any and all the storage on the server and all storage on the server\u2019s network. Automatic Backup of Photos and Videos To Your Own Storage FileFlex allows you to back up your photos and videos from as many smart phones as you want to whatever storage you own.  You can even set it to only back up when connected via WiFi so as to not use up your cellular data.SecurityWith FileFlex, your files stay in their source locations and nothing is copied to a third party.  Access and sharing uses high level encryption.  Sharing is permission-based, to confirmed contacts only - not a link that can be forwarded or shared on social media.\u00a0 Sharing can be revoked at any time and can be restricted to \u2018view or stream only\u2019 with downloading of shared files prohibited.  Finally it includes an activity log so that you can know who accessed and/or downloaded shared files and when.\nFileFlex \u2013 Access Share Stream for Android official Trailer\n\n\n\n"},

Plus you can control other devices like Air Conditioners, Fans, Lights, and more. This application will turn phones and tablets with a built in remote IR blaster into a fully functioning universal remote. \u2022 Easy to Configure and Use \u2022You can easily browse through all of the different categories and code sets to find the best remote that works for you. All saved remotes can be quickly and easily accessed from the sliding menu panel. \u2022 How IR Universal Remote Works \u2022Many phones today have hardware built in for controlling TVs. This hardware is called an IR Blaster. Manufactures such as Samsung, LG, HTC, Xiaomi, and Huawei are using the IR Blaster in their phones. It emits an infrared signal which can be picked up and interpreted by the TV. IR Universal Remote has a very large database containing the proper codes for many different devices. It can emit these codes through the IR Blaster just like a physical universal remote. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_devices_with_IR_blaster\u2022 Loaded with Features \u2022Create completely custom remotes. You can edit almost every aspect of your remote. Change the toolbar color. Edit the background color or upload a background image. Edit button IR codes, colors, positions, roundness, transparency, and texts. Use the two widgets to quickly and easily control devices from your home screen. Use the notification remote to control devices while using other apps. Control multiple devices from 1 remote. Setup macros to send multiple commands to multiple devices with a single button click. If you have the IR Universal Smart Hub then you can connect to multiple hubs at once for controlling devices in different rooms. You can also read infrared codes directly from other remotes into the Smart Hub and the App.\u2022 Instructional Video \u2022 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuDCNaDrL-Q&feature=youtu.be\u2022 Interesting Fact \u2022 The Remote has over 57 different names. Different countries may use different words to describe it. What do you call yours? Do you call it the Clicker or the Flicker? What about the Zapper? You might even think of it as the Doo-dah or the Doofer. \u2022 More Great Remote Words \u2022Switcher, Dooberry, Dangle, Thing, Hopper, Stick, Do-for, Flapper, Dingle, Clacker, Wand, Changer, Mote, Manda a Distancia, IoT Internet of Things\u2022 Permissions \u2022Photos and Media (Optional): This allows you to add your own custom images and graphics into the app. You can add images from your image folders to the remote background.

This is not a stand-alone app and will not function without SoundBox PC software installed on the same network.   If you have problems - please email me - see below.   *** Important *** \u2022\u2003 WiFi must be enabled. \u2022\u2003 Firewall must allow port 8095 access (normally done by SoundBox). \u2022\u2003 \"Enable Remote Device Connection\" and \"Timer\" must be enabled in SoundBox \"Remote Devices\" settings. If it does not have these options, then you need a more recent version of SoundBox on your PC. It is recommended to enter a \"Remote Access Code\" (Password) in SoundBox settings section. This prevents unauthorised access. This app will ask you to enter the password when you try to connect. Talk names in different languages are transferred to SoundBox Timer. Some further work will be done on translation of this app. When first started, the app searches the local network to find SoundBox. If found, the name and IP address of the SounBox server will be shown. If there is more than one SoundBox PC, they will be shown. Tap on the required server name to connect. If a timer has already been started, then the app will display this timer. The app is very simple to use and has few options. These include the ability to restrict the display to show only the correct timers for that day. To do this, the meeting days need to be set correctly first. If the timer is for a student talk, then a bell button will be shown and is enabled when the item goes over-time. The bell will sound through the Kingdom Hall speakers. A WiFi indicator will be green when you have a good connection. It may be necessary to sit in a good location for WiFi. The app will keep your device awake - so make sure your battery is OK first.

And even with proper setup, access is still quite limited, allowing connection to only one HMI within the remote network. However, with EasyAccess 2.0, this is about to change.EasyAccess 2.0 is a new way to access an HMI from anywhere in the world. With EasyAccess 2.0, it becomes very easy to monitor and troubleshoot HMI\u2019s/PLC\u2019s that are at a remote location as long as Internet connection is available. As EasyAccess 2.0 already takes care of network settings and addresses security issues, the user can connect easily to the HMIs as if they were on the local network. Moreover, it is possible to have multiple available HMIs within a network.EasyAccess is also a remote supporting service. Consider the case in which a machine builder sells his machine with a Weintek HMI installed. One of his oversea customers is reporting a problem, which may or may not require inspection by an engineer. The machine builder can remotely connect to the HMI through EasyAccess 2.0 to investigate the problem. The customer needs no extra network configuration and just need to plug in Internet connection. In addition, the machine builder can also update the HMI project, monitor the PLC by Ethernet Pass-through, or even update the PLC program.\nEasyAccess 2.0 for Android official Trailer\n\n\n\n"},

It's not just a \"find my phone\" app or a phone tracker, Cerberus has many unique features that make it the perfect app to locate your phone or tablet, identify the thief and get back your device.Install Cerberus and try it for free for one week, then you can buy a license for your account from within the app or from the web dashboard.It has three ways to protect your device. These are the \"3 heads\" of Cerberus:- Remote control through the website https://www.cerberusapp.com- Remote control via SMS (text messages) from another phone- Automatic alertsREMOTE CONTROLRemote control allows you to perform many operations on your lost or stolen device, like:- Locate and track it- Lock the device with a code- Start a loud alarm, even if the device is set to silent mode- Display a message that stays on the screen, and also make your device speak the message- Take pictures, screenshots and even record videos, to identify the thief- Get the location history, to see where the device has been in the past- Wipe the internal memory and the SD card, to protect your personal data- Hide Cerberus from the app drawer, so the app will be stealthy and a thief will not see the icon- Record audio from the microphone- Get a list of last calls sent and received- Get information about cell phone network and WiFi network the device is connected to, and nearby WiFi networks- Start a remote shell (SSH-like), to execute commands as if the device were connected to your computer with a USB cable- And much more!AUTOMATIC ALERTSCerberus can automatically perform actions when some conditions are met. For instance, it will send email/SMS alerts if the SIM card is changed (see the \"SIM checker\" section of the settings) and it will email you a photo of the thief when a wrong unlock code is entered (section \"Automatic photo capture\").You can also set your own rules, see the \"AutoTask\" section! From there you can set geofencing (alerts when the phone exits or enters an area) and a lot of more automatic actions and alerts.ADVANCED FEATURESFrom within the app configuration, you can enable some options to make difficult for the thief to disable or uninstall Cerberus. Make sure to enable the \"Device Administration\" functionality and the \"Protect device admin\" option. Also you can block the Power Menu to prevent the thief from shutting down the device, and block access to the status bar in the lock screen, so nobody would be able to change the quick settings in Lollipop (Android 5.0) and later versions.If you have rooted your device you can install Cerberus as a system application and get many additional features, including complete uninstall protection (Cerberus will survive a factory reset) and GPS auto-enabling when you start tracking the device. See the Help page on our website for more information on that.The app works even if the device does not have an internet connection thanks to remote control by sms messages. Also, the SIM Checker feature allows you to know the new number to send texts to, if the SIM card is changed.If you have an Android Wear smartwatch, make sure to check the \"Wearable device\" section of the app settings: you will find many useful and cool features.Please read the Help page on our website (https://www.cerberusapp.com/help.php), it has the answers to the most frequently asked questions. If you have any questions not covered there, feature requests or experience any issues, contact us at [email\u00a0protected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */ and we will be happy to help!\nCerberus anti theft for Android official Trailer\n\n\n\n"},
