It uses the command line, with many powerful and robust open-source applications, plus a custom ASCII on-screen 'soft' keyboard that works well (You must ENABLE it in your device's main Keyboard Settings).. and also has an extensive generic external 'hard' keyboard key mapper. This way CTRL / ALT / ESC etc.. should all be accessible. GCC 4.4.0, make 3.82, ctags, javac, java, dx, proguard, aapt, apkbuilder, signer, ssh, sshd, telnetd, bash 4.2, busybox 1.19.2, vim 7.3, nano 2.2.6, midnight commander 4.8, htop 1.0, TMUX 1.5, links 2.7, rsync 3.0.8, git 1.7.8, BitchX 1.1 and a nice terminal emulator are all available.The vim editor has been setup with c / java / HTML development in mind and is extremely powerful. Also vim has been setup by default in a humane way (arrow keys work, backspace..), so that starting on this long and glorious journey won't begin with a punch in the face. With the addition of all the other apps provided, Terminal IDE becomes much MUCH more than an extremely powerful IDE. One could call it a complete 'Command Line OS'.Best of all you can log in via telnet / ssh and use your home keyboard/screen combo! AND the whole app runs WITHOUT needing ROOT permissions.It's all available with normal user permissions..Also the project is released under GPLv2http://code.google.com/p/terminal-ide/Enjoy!Constructive criticism always welcome. Useless abuse, not so much.SpartacusNB: This app CANNOT be installed onto the SDCard because you do not get 'Execute' permissions on that mount. It must run in this app's private memory on the device [Also much more secure]. You can of course still read / write to the SDCard and store your files / projects there. ALSO - once extracted it takes up about 150MB of your INTERNAL memory. You have been warned.. NB2: 'ENTER NOT WORKING' confusion on Terminal IDE keyboard.. Android expects a different key-code than the terminal(which expects ^M).   - Use CTRL+ENTER to send Android ENTER at any time.   - GO,NEXT,SEND & SEARCH all work when they appear as icons.NB3: The Help/Tutorials, available in the app, can now be downloaded separately as a PDF from the Google code project.

These are licensed, trained, experienced, and accredited psychologists (PhD / PsyD), marriage and family therapists (MFT), clinical social workers (LCSW), licensed professional counselors (LPC), or similar credentials. All of them have a Masters Degree or a Doctorate Degree in their field. They have been qualified and certified by their state professional board after successfully completing the necessary education, exams, training and practice. They all possess at least 3 years and 2,000 hours of hands-on experience.After you sign up, we will match you to an available counselor who fits your objectives, preferences, and the type of issues you are dealing with. Different counselors have different approaches and areas of focus so it's important to find the right person who can achieve the best results for you. HOW DOES IT WORK?You and your counselor will get a dedicated \u201croom\u201d, which will be your private and secured place to communicate. This room is open 24/7. You can enter it at any time, from any Internet-connected device wherever your are. In this room, you will write about yourself, the things going on in your life, ask questions and discuss the issues that trouble you. Your counselor will login to the same room, read your messages and respond with feedback, insights, and guidance. Your counselor will help you learn about the issues that hold you back and prepare you to move forward. This ongoing one-on-one dialog is the basis of your work with your counselor. Together you will build towards making a positive change in your life and accomplishing your goals.HOW MANY SESSIONS CAN I HAVE WITH MY COUNSELOR?You are not limited in the number of messages (\u201csessions\u201d) you can have with your counselor. The frequency of your sessions would vary based on your availability, and the interaction between you and your counselor. For example, some people have 3-4 short interactions every week, while others prefer to have one very long and thorough session. You may use the service extensively during time of need and use it sparsely at other times. Your counselor would try to accommodate your changing needs in a timely manner.HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?Many people avoid getting professional help because it can become extremely expensive. We want to make BetterHelp easy and accessible to everyone, so we've created a plan which is simple, predictable, risk-free, and very affordable.Plans range from as low as $35 per week. With any plan you choose, you will pay a fraction of the cost of traditional counseling.Last, if you accomplished your goals or if you found it to be no longer helpful for any reason, you can simply cancel the subscription. Canceling is easy and done online - there are no hoops to jump through.YOU DESERVE TO BE HAPPY. WE ARE HERE TO HELP MAKE IT HAPPEN.\n"},

Works with all applications! Easy to use software! Now You can freely visit ALL SITES in any part of the world. Securely encrypt your internet connection and protect your online identity!The main advantages of this technology:- VPN (IPSEC VPN and OpenVPN)- Cloud VPN (Personal server, UDP protocol)- VPN+TOR - You can select VPN location now.- Access to any restricted website.- Full tracking and interception protection.- Full local network attack protection.- Presence of the Firewall, that prevents the scanning of your IP address by Internet intruders.- Open Internet access despite all the local or state restrictions.- Wi-Fi network scan and data acquisition protection.- Full access to all VOIP carriers including Skype.- Completely anonymous Internet access.What is a VPN?A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a clever piece of technology that gives you the choice from being an ordinary Internet user \u2013 to being an Internet VIP. It\u2019s like having a golden ticket for the Internet - it will let you bypass censorship, unblock content and protects your privacy and security whilst you\u2019re online.Why do you need a VPN? Anytime you use a public internet service you are putting your security and privacy at risk. Personal data can easily be misused and stolen in cafes, hotels, airports and other free Wi-Fi hotspots. Globus Free Pro VPN offers you government-level protection and peace of mind for your personal data whenever you surf the internet \u2013 wherever you are.Globus VPN/TOR Free Pro  has the added benefit of allowing you to unblock favourite websites, services and content by switching country. With Globus VPN/TOR you can ensure that you\u2019ll enjoy all your favourite internet services and sites, no matter where you are.Globus VPN + TOR\u2026This is a perfect security solution when users can route Tor through VPN services which will prevent your ISP from seeing that you're using Tor. On one hand, VPNs are more popular than Tor, so you won't stand out as much but on the other hand, in some countries replacing an encrypted Tor connection with an encrypted VPN connection, would be suspicious as well but not with Globus VPN where one can select a specific server in a specific country of your choice. Once the VPN client has connected, the VPN tunnel will be the machine's default Internet connection, and TBB (Tor Browser Bundle) (or Tor client) will route through it.Another advantage here is that this prevents Tor from seeing who you are behind the Globus VPN. So if somebody somehow does manage to break Tor and learn the IP address your traffic is coming from, but your VPN was actually following through on their premises (they won't watch, they won't remember, and they will somehow magically make it so nobody else is watching either), then you'll be better off. But this will not happen. VPN BROWSER FOR PC IN OUR SITE: Anonymously encrypt all traffic! Works with all applications! Easy to use software!

Anonymous is a loosely associated international network of activist and hacktivist entities. A website nominally associated with the group describes it as \"an Internet gathering\" with \"a very loose and decentralized command structure that operates on ideas rather than directives\". The group became known for a series of well-publicized publicity stunts and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on government, religious, and corporate websites. Anonymous originated in 2003 on the imageboard 4chan, representing the concept of many online and offline community users simultaneously existing as an anarchic, digitized global brain.

Nothing to be installed on your computer. Sync automatically even before you enter your home with 'If connected to WiFi router'.SHARING MUST BE ENABLED ON YOUR COMPUTER, the simplest way to do this on Windows is to right click the folder you wish to synchronize select Share With and go with the instructions. Restart of the PC sometimes is needed when sharing for the very first time.For best performance when screen goes off, configure WiFi sleep policy to Never and Best WiFi Performance in your device Settings-Wireless&Networks-WiFi Settings-Advanced (you may need to hit menu button to get to the Advanced).Features:Two and one-way sync.Sync deletions.Schedule sync by combination of interval, exact time of the day, weekday, when device connects to a specific WiFi router and when power charging. Include/exclude filter for hidden, read protected, individual files/folders, file name pattern, file type (extension), file date.VPN and Portable WiFi Hot Spot over cellular connections.Wake up PC (WOL) either manually or on a scheduled sync.Organize pictures by date and/or address. Organize mp3 music by artist and/or album and rename to the original song name.Cut, copy, paste, preview remote and local files.Uses Windows shares, Samba on Linux and older Macs, CIFS (SMB) protocol.Hidden sneaky costs: There are four premium (paid) features in this app: 1) Schedule with router 2) Weekly schedule 3) Include/Exclude directories and files, new extensions and regular expressions 4) Wake up PC before sync. One time ~3$ donation covers them all and any upcoming premium feature. Previous version 1$ per feature payments can be asked to refund by email if donation is made.Known issues:1) Insufficient resources error on Windows:Check file path on Windows, paths are limited to 260 character after long files names were replaced with their short names.Also looks like Windows sometimes is not fast enough to reclaim resources. Changing registry seems to help: \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\LanmanServer\\Parameters\\Size\"  32) Devices with Android 4.4.2 update do not have write permission for external sd card. Nothing I can do about it. https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=638793) Paid features sometimes do not unlock. Reinstalling app/waiting for a few hours usually resolves the issue.4) App will fail without warning or error on file/directory names having more than 127 non- ASCII and 255 ASCII characters long.https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=176845) Some routers with NAS capability (USB plug), have no permission to update time stamps on FAT volumes. Workaround - format usb flash drive or external hard drive NTFS.6) Windows 8.1 seems to use email address instead of normal user name on some configurations.7) Unsupported request error or incorrect disk is full message, computer probably does not support free space request. Set disk space limit to 0 in the app's Settings.8) Order validation failed upon reinstallation - send me an email, will be fixed for the next version.9) Directories ending with dot (.) are not supported neither by Samba nor by Windows. Exclude these directories using app's Filter.This software was tested with PCs running Windows (XP, 7, 8), Linux. Works on Mac but was not officially tested.\n"},

This client allows bidders who are invited to Handbid(TM) powered silent auctions to bid on items from their mobile device, manage bids and proxy bids, checkout, issue payment, and get a receipt.Handbid has powered hundreds of events and delighted thousands of bidders in the process. With native apps for iPhone and Android as well as a kiosk app available for the iPad for non-smartphone users, there is not a better experience and solution for running your silent auction. Here are 3 great reasons to use Handbid for your next event:1. Our mobile app experience is second to none. Your bidders will love it! And yes, they WILL download an app on their phone!  For those bidders without a supported device, they can either bid from the web on their phone or from our BidPad (TM) kiosk for iPad.  2. Handbid is built for FUNDRAISERS by FUNDRAISERS.  Handbid has been powering silent auctions since 2011 and we have been running auctions ourselves much longer than that. We know how hard it is and we have built this system to make it EASY for you, your volunteers, and your guests. 3. Our commitment to service is as great as our software.  We get as many (if not more) compliments on our customer service as we do on our software.  You can be assured we will do everything we can to make your experience as smooth and easy as possible. Common questions about Handbid:- How does it work?Your guests will either download our app, bid from the web on their phone, bid from their computer, or from an iPad kiosk.  Everything is real-time and Handbid allows your guests to bid from multiple places and interfaces. - What people people don&apos;t have a smartphone or don&apos;t want to download an app?Over 90% of your users will show up with an iPhone or Android.  We also have an iPad App BidPad (TM). Anyone can bid from BidPad app using a Paddle ID. It&apos;s a great solution for those who can&apos;t use their smartphone.  But, if you have that Windows Phone user or one that shows up with a (sigh) Blackberry and insists on using it..Well they can bid from the Web at handbid.com. Its mobile optimized and works great!- Can people pay though HandbidYes! We have integrated payments in the app so that at the end of the night, your guests can view and pay their invoice without having to stand in line.  Can you accept payments outside of Handbid? Sure (cash, check or your own CC system)- Do you provide on-site support?Yes we can do that. We have built Handbid to be easy enough to use where you can train and do it yourself, but we certainly do offer onsite experts who can do it all for you or even just provide extra \"tech support\" the day of your event. - How much does it cost?We offer a number of fixed price packages that are based on the size and number of events you run. Please contact us and we can provide you up to date pricing for your event. - It looks cool, but is it worth the investment? Absolutely.  Sure, you expected to hear us say that. But remember, we are fundraisers too for our own charities. We know you are on a tight budget and you want to maximize dollars for your program services.  Handbid MORE than pays for itself.  Most of our clients see anywhere from a 30% to 50% increase over what they did before.  Some even higher.  Put it this way, this is one investment that will generate more revenue at your event.  You can&apos;t say the same for your caterer, venue or even the band.  What are you waiting for? Download the app already? Sign up! Its free to check out. Just go into our demo auction and start to bid around.  Trust us, we won&apos;t make you pay for what you bid on there!  Also check out our iPad kiosk app, and our iPhone apps in the iTunes App Store.  Play with all of them!Have fun, play around, then give us a call and lets get started! Your bidders are waiting for an awesome auction experience.  Don&apos;t deny them what they deserve! With love - The Handbid Team\n"},

This attribute has created a rock solid merchants/retailers and brands relationship as a particular city is mapped comprehensively.How it works:-1-\tDownload the GDP Merchant application and register with your complete details.2-\tGDP team will receive the notification and approve the merchant/retailer and or brand.3-\tUpon approval of the merchant/retailer and or brand by the GDP team, the merchant/retailer and or brand will be allotted a reference number (which basically acts as an ID).4-\t The merchant/retailer and or brand, will need to upload the percentage of discount they would like to offer on their services along with the display image.5-\tGDP team will receive the notification and approve the caliber of discount and the type of offers.6-\tPost all approvals, the offers and deals are live on the GDP consumer App.7-\tMerchant/retailer and or brand have the ability to add hourly, daily or new offers.8-\tMerchant/retailer and or brand need to insert the coupon ID of each consumer on the merchant app when their service is complete.9-\tMerchant Introduction Program (MIP), is to help the merchant/retailer and or brand to generate more business and cater to a larger consumer base.10-\tRights of admission is reserved by the merchant/retailer and or brand, service is subject to availability, T&C and Privacy policy apply to both the merchant/retailer and or brand and consumer.11-\tMerchant/retailer and or brand - need to have the GDP stickers and pin up notice on their premises. 12-\tMerchant/retailer and or brand have to ensure that their management and staff are well aware about the association with GDP.13-\tMerchant/retailer and or brand - have to ensure that the registered mobile number and email associated with GDP for all consumer purchases is at all times active in their location and point of sales.14-\tAs per agreement, an merchant/retailer and or brand with three consumer complaints and or three denied service to the consumer will be booted out and the offers will be withdrawn from the platform.15-\tIn an event you would like to become a part of the \"Great Discount Card\" - www.injectedgdc.com, please send an email to [email\u00a0protected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */\nGreat Discount Place- MERCHANT for Android official Trailer\n\n\n\n"},

A website nominally associated with the group describes it as \"an Internet gathering\" with \"a very loose and decentralized command structure that operates on ideas rather than directives\". The group became known for a series of well-publicized publicity stunts and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on government, religious, and corporate websites. Anonymous originated in 2003 on the imageboard 4chan, representing the concept of many online and offline community users simultaneously existing as an anarchic, digitized global brain. Anonymous members (known as \"Anons\") can be distinguished in public by the wearing of Guy Fawkes masks in the style portrayed in the graphic novel and film V for Vendetta.In its early form, the concept was adopted by a decentralized online community acting anonymously in a coordinated manner, usually toward a loosely self-agreed goal, and primarily focused on entertainment, or \"lulz\". Beginning with 2008's Project Chanology\u2014a series of protests, pranks, and hacks targeting the Church of Scientology\u2014the Anonymous collective became increasingly associated with collaborative hacktivism on a number of issues internationally. Individuals claiming to align themselves with Anonymous undertook protests and other actions (including direct action) in retaliation against copyright-focused campaigns by motion picture and recording industry trade associations. Later targets of Anonymous hacktivism included government agencies of the U.S., Israel, Tunisia, Uganda, and others; the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant; child pornography sites; copyright protection agencies; the Westboro Baptist Church; and corporations such as PayPal, MasterCard, Visa, and Sony. Anons have publicly supported WikiLeaks and the Occupy movement.Beautiful Anonymous Wallpaper is 100% free application that help you save or download Beautiful Anonymous Wallpapers to your mobile.

And just when you think, such a simple battery bar can display such a crucial information, try plugging in your charger - you'll be amazed by the details of the animation you'll see. The pulsating animation and the bar together not only indicates the current Battery level but also how much has the Battery charged since you plugged in your charger. Got a full charge? The line will cover the whole width of your screen.Battery depleting? So will the length of Energy Bar.The latest update of the App let's Energy Bar feel all privileged as it's now more integrated with the device in the form of an Accessibility Service. To you as an user it means, Energy Bar will be very reliable and fits well with the System. And to complement the integration, a nice UI which let's you perform all sort of configuration on the Bar while it's live on your screen.Out of the box features:-\u2713 Energy Bar can be configured from a width of 1 pixel to cover the entire status bar (pro)\u2713 Energy Bar puts almost 0% load on CPU, as it wakes up only to reflect any change in battery level\u2713 Energy Bar's origin can be configured as left/center/right\u2713 Energy Bar can hide on fullscreen content (apps, videos, images, games etc)\u2713 Energy Bar can be configured to change colors automatically depending on the live battery level\u2713 Energy Bar could have a mono color/multiple color segments/gradient (pro)\u2713 You can literally assign any color in the world for your favorite configuration\u2713 Energy Bar as a cool pulsating animation whenever a power source is plugged into your deviceAll that is cool! But what about Energy Bar consuming Battery?!This is one of the most exciting question for me to answer. Energy Bar more than anything understands that you need to utilize your battery efficiently (after all, that's why you installed the App, right? ;) .) Energy Bar sits on the screen silently putting almost 0% load on CPU, if battery level changes, Android wakes up Energy Bar. Once awake, Energy Bar quickly updates itself and goes back to sleep. And to be that extra efficient, the Bar goes on deep sleep when you turn off the screen, meaning it doesn't even read changes in battery level when the screen is off.Note: If you face any issues/warnings with Secure Startup when you enable Energy Bar, please note that it's an Android bug (https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/37010136). Just disable Secure Startup temporarily, enable Energy Bar and then finally re-enable Secure Startup for everything to work in harmony.Do you receive 'Permission Denied' message? Just follow this sequence: Uninstall the App > Reboot your device (clears the App's cache) > Install the App.Accessibility Service's permission requirement: Users have been enjoying the ultra stability and reliability of Energy Bar every since version 5.0. And that's because it now runs as an Accessibility Service.

WRFG provides a voice for those who have been traditionally denied access to the broadcast media and the involvement of a broad base of community elements to guarantee that access. In the utilization of the Foundation&apos;s facilities and in its programs the following communities will receive first priority: 1. Those who continue to be denied free and open access to the broadcast media, 2. Those who suffer oppression or exploitation based upon class, race, sex, age or creed or sexual orientation. Since going on the air in 1973, WRFG has filled a void on the Atlanta airwaves. WRFG was the first Atlanta radio station since the 1950s to feature such regional musical forms as blues, bluegrass and jazz. Reflecting Atlanta&apos;s emergence as an \"international city\", it pioneered programming oriented toward the area&apos;s growing Latin, African, Asian and Caribbean communities. WRFG was the first station to carry live broadcasts from the Arts Festival of Atlanta and the Georgia Grassroots Festival. WRFG&apos;s achievements extend beyond music alone. WRFG produced live broadcasts of speakers at the Hungry Club, Atlanta&apos;s famous weekly interracial forum. It was the first and only radio station to air the work of local poets, playwrights and authors on a regular basis. WRFG has also initiated programming directed toward Atlanta&apos;s neighborhoods, the disabled, alternative lifestyles, and other special audiences. Its in-depth coverage of event such as the 1987 rebellion at the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary has received widespread acclaim. WRFG&apos;s documentaries merit special attention. Between 1977 and 1980, WRFG produced the 50-part \"Living Atlanta!&apos; series on Atlanta&apos;s history. \"Living Atlanta!&apos; won national awards and established a tradition of documentary excellence at WRFG. In the fall of 1989, the University of Georgia Press published a book based on this award-winning series. In October 1995, WRFG attained its ultimate goal, broadcasting at 100,000 watts of power. The following year WRFG began the World Party Tours broadcasting live from various locations around the world. In 1996, the first World Party Tour took WRFG to Jamaica. The same year WRFG went to Dublin, Ireland to broadcast the legendary St. Patrick&apos;s Day Parade. In July 1998, WRFG celebrated 25 years of service to the community. World Party Tour &apos;99 brought the Paint It Jazz Festival in Bridgetown, Barbados live to Atlanta in January of that year.\n"},

It uses the command line, with many powerful and robust open-source applications, plus a custom ASCII on-screen 'soft' keyboard that works well (You must ENABLE it in your device's main Keyboard Settings).. and also has an extensive generic external 'hard' keyboard key mapper. This way CTRL / ALT / ESC etc.. should all be accessible. GCC 4.4.0, make 3.82, ctags, javac, java, dx, proguard, aapt, apkbuilder, signer, ssh, sshd, telnetd, bash 4.2, busybox 1.19.2, vim 7.3, nano 2.2.6, midnight commander 4.8, htop 1.0, TMUX 1.5, links 2.7, rsync 3.0.8, git 1.7.8, BitchX 1.1 and a nice terminal emulator are all available.The vim editor has been setup with c / java / HTML development in mind and is extremely powerful. Also vim has been setup by default in a humane way (arrow keys work, backspace..), so that starting on this long and glorious journey won't begin with a punch in the face. With the addition of all the other apps provided, Terminal IDE becomes much MUCH more than an extremely powerful IDE. One could call it a complete 'Command Line OS'.Best of all you can log in via telnet / ssh and use your home keyboard/screen combo! AND the whole app runs WITHOUT needing ROOT permissions.It's all available with normal user permissions..Also the project is released under GPLv2http://code.google.com/p/terminal-ide/Enjoy!Constructive criticism always welcome. Useless abuse, not so much.SpartacusNB: This app CANNOT be installed onto the SDCard because you do not get 'Execute' permissions on that mount. It must run in this app's private memory on the device [Also much more secure]. You can of course still read / write to the SDCard and store your files / projects there. ALSO - once extracted it takes up about 150MB of your INTERNAL memory. You have been warned.. NB2: 'ENTER NOT WORKING' confusion on Terminal IDE keyboard.. Android expects a different key-code than the terminal(which expects ^M).   - Use CTRL+ENTER to send Android ENTER at any time.   - GO,NEXT,SEND & SEARCH all work when they appear as icons.NB3: The Help/Tutorials, available in the app, can now be downloaded separately as a PDF from the Google code project. Thanx to Roy. NB4: This app is ARM only.. No x86 support. Sorry - and yes, it's a big job to convert..NB5: No UTF-8 support yet.. Just ASCII.NB6: READ ALL THE IN-APP HELP! TWICE! BEFORE YOU EMAIL ME!

Free and contains no Adware. Does not connect to the internet.In our continued effort to make this work with KitKat, we have had mixed results.  So, if you are running KitKat, it may or may not work for you until I get time to investigate the issues with some phones. But, it's a free app with no ads and works for most people.Please provide feedback to the developer rather than giving a low rating so that I can fix whatever is wrong. Also feel free to suggest improvements. Thank you.It is possible to forensically extract information from a smart phone using mobile forensic tools such as Cellebrite and XRY even after it has been deleted. This utility can help to prevent that from happening by sanitizing the free space on a phone. Similar functionality can be found on desktop machines using utilities like CCleaner, Eraser, and File Shredder.  If you are afraid of the government peeking at your phone and extracting and reconstructing deleted files, this is the app that you want.This application does not delete files or clean the cache. Use other tools such as ES File Explorer and AVG Cleaner to delete files and clean the cache.  Then use this utility to sanitize the free space.  The free version of this application does not sanitize database areas such as contacts, phone logs, or SMS text messages. Look for a pro version in the future that may perform a more thorough sanitization.Although we cannot guarantee that all free space will be sanitized, this application finds all of the free space that Android will give us in three primary areas where data is normally stored and overwrites it as completely as the phone will allow:1. System - This is the protected data area shared by all applications. 2. SD Card - On some phones this is the actual SD Card and on others it is emulated SD Card space.3. Optional SD Card - On some phones this is the actual SD Card and many other phones do not have this space. Samsung phones typically put the real external SD Card here.To run the application:1. Make sure that the phone has good battery/wall power.2. Put a checkmark next to the sections of memory to sanitize.3. Press the Start Wiping button.4. Do not use the phone while the application is working.The status area will indicate how the process is going.Some have complained that after a wipe, they sometimes still see old files that were deleted using Hexamob or other similar apps.  In my investigation I have found that the overwhelming majority of files are overwritten but occassionally one file is left intact.  This could occur if Android does not allow us to write to every free sector. Watch the statistics as it is overwriting to see if the free space count goes to 0 as it is writing. Also run the app more than once to get more thorough wiping since SD cards rotate their sectors in and out of service.Many SD cards rotate blocks of memory in and out of use for wear leveling.  As a result, it is possible that after sanitizing memory there could be some blocks that get rotated back in to use that were never sanitized.  To mitigate this possibility, run this application twice which statistically will usually hit all blocks of memory. This application has not been tested on all phones.  Please provide feedback to the developer about any problems.  It has been found to work on Samsung Galaxy S2, S3, S4 and Victory phones, the HTC Arrive and others.  System space takes several minutes to sanitize and 8GB SD Cards can take up to half an hour.  If the application is aborted before it finishes, there may be large files left on the phone. If this happens, simply reboot the phone and bring the application up and it will automatically look for these files and delete them at startup.\n"},

I'll attend to your queries ASAPTEXT AIDE provides you some useful utilitiesDEFINEThis feature shows you a swift little pop-up with the definition of the word. Ideal when you are reading an e-book or a news article and find it rather distracting to open a dictionary app again and again.\ud83d\udd36 There are three ways to do this- First is to activate a feature called \"Copy Aide\" from settings. As the name suggests, you just have to select some text and hit the copy button to see the definition of the word. It can be easily paused from the notification when not needed.Enabling the + button shows you a pop-up with the copied text, which is useful in apps like WhatsApp where a word can't be selected singularly from the chats- Second is to Share the text and click on Define- Third is to use the homescreen widget.- For Play Books you can also use \"Web search\" feature. And for Moon+, FB Reader dictionary feature, choose \"ColorDict\" \ud83d\udd36 Offline definitions available in 5 languages: English, French, German, Italian and Spanish (A very big thanks to Livio for providing access to their data)To get more languages, you can also use my app Dict Aide, which supports StarDict dictionary packs. \ud83d\udd36 Online thesaurus with a list of synonyms and antonyms \ud83d\udd36 In addition to that, you can quickly switch to Wikipedia for additional information and Wiktionary for languages that currently do not have offline access. You can do this in any language! Just modify it in the settings.EXPANDThis gives you system wide text expansion. You can define a macro (shortcut) like @addhome to type your full home address! Very useful if you type something often.Just set a shorthand and let Text Aide do the rest!Also includes dynamic macros like current date, time etc. Check out the whole list under Expand > Settings[Only works on Android versions greater than 4.3 if Xposed framework in not available on your device]SEARCH+You can add a list of your favourite search engines and access them quickly from a sidebar. Also includes a floating browser- First way is to use Copy Aide and enable the search button from the notification.- Second is to share the text and then select Search+- Third is to use the search button in AOSP (based) browsers or apps like Wikipedia.- It can also be done using the homescreen widgetSHAREYou can do the following things by sharing text\ud83d\udd36 Copy - As the name suggests, you can copy it from the share menuThis will also be shown in browser selection menu (when you tap on a link).\ud83d\udd36 Dial You can use the shared text to place a call.\ud83d\udd36 Open As URL - This allows you to open the selected text in the web browser as a URL/link (if it's valid).SPEAKUsing this feature, you can make (almost) any text on your device speak using TTS engine.This can be very useful if you're learning a new language!- First way is to use Copy Aide and enable the Speak button from the notification.- Second is to share the text and then select 'Speak' from the dialog- It can also be done using the homescreen widget\u2795 Xposed gives you additional control. You can double tap a TextView (which means fields like WhatsApp chat bubbles, YouTube comments, Play store description,etc) to force selection.This, however, has some limitations and might not work in all apps.You will also get all the five buttons (Define, Dial, Search+, Share & Speak) in the contextual action bar on selecting some text in most apps.For Chrome, you can use my module called Chrome Selection PatchBrowsers like Dolphin, Opera, etc are not supported \ud83d\udca1 If you have suggestions, queries, complaints, etc feel free to send an e-mail, visit the Google+ commuity or XDA support page [ http://bit.ly/XDATX ]\nText Aide for Android official Trailer\n\n\n\n"},

It works in a way that a person publish a special link that contains a website, an Email address and an hashtag.The app recognize the link and can load it, then its able to browse into the destination website without actually showing it, and open the mail app with the destination address and the hash tag as the mail title (notify about the protest reason is legally important in some countries).Those protest posts on social media with tens of thousands of likes? now can be converted to tens of thousands of fake views, and real Emails.The link can be generated inside the app, and looks like this -http:[email\u00a0protected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> *//#examplehttp://sudfeld.io - is so the app will recognize the linkhttp can also be httpswww.example.com is the destination domain or IP[email\u00a0protected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */ is the destination Email address#example is the hash tag to be sent as titleDigital protest is different from a DDoS attack, here the user doesn&apos;t aggressively refresh the page nor send multiply Emails.Each one enter ones to the site, and send one mail describing the protest (even if by an hashtag).Developers:This is a first prototype of something that could be a lot bigger, you can find the code on github.com/edenberger/android-DigitalProtest under GPLThe TODO list is long, the major things are to add a server side and an Iphone version, other things are graphics, an organized petition and a phone number instead of a website (legal conflicts might arise)Legal:No data is being sent out of the app except for the different destination websites.No data is being collected except for default Google analytics.I am not to be held responsible for any damage that might occur from using this app to any side.The use of this application is under the user&apos;s responsibility.\n"},

Orbot uses Tor to encrypt your Internet traffic and then hides it by bouncing through a series of computers around the world. Tor is free software and an open network that helps you defend against a form of network surveillance that threatens personal freedom and privacy, confidential business activities and relationships, and state security known as traffic analysis.*** Android 4.0 and lower, you can download older versions from https://guardianproject.info/releases/ or through the FDroid.org open app store at https://f-droid.org. The last release with KitKat and older support is: https://guardianproject.info/releases/Orbot-v14.1.4-UpToKitKat-nonPIE.apk ****** SAMSUNG GALAXY USERS ***On some devices, aSamsung app is listening on the same network port that Orbot needs. Download 'SockStat' from Google Play. Look for the app on port 9050. Force stop and disable that app. You can also try to change Orbot's \"Tor SOCKS\" setting under the Debug section to 9051 or AUTO. You can see the fix in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yK-nK4F67_g*****Orbot is the only app that creates a truly private internet connection. As the New York Times writes, \u201cwhen a communication arrives from Tor, you can never know where or whom it\u2019s from.\u201d Tor won the 2012 Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) Pioneer Award.\u2605 ACCEPT NO SUBSTITUTES: Orbot is the safest way to use the Internet on Android. Period. Orbot bounces your encrypted traffic several times through computers around the world, instead of connecting you directly like VPNs and proxies. This process takes a little longer, but the strongest privacy and identity protection available is worth the wait.\u2605 PRIVATE WEB SURFING: Use with Orfox, the most anonymous way to access any website, even if it\u2019s normally blocked, monitored, or on the hidden web. Get Orfox: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.guardianproject.orfox\u2605 PRIVACY FOR APPS: Any installed app can use Tor if it has a proxy feature, using the settings found here: https://goo.gl/2OA1y Use Orbot with Twitter, or try private web searching with DuckDuckGo: https://goo.gl/lgh1p\u2605 PRIVACY FOR EVERYONE: Tor can help you confidentially research a competitor, get around someone blocking your favorite site, or circumvent a firewall to watch sports at work.\u2605 PRIVACY MADE EASY: Check out our fun, interactive walkthrough: https://guardianproject.info/howto/browsefreely\u2605 IT\u2019S OFFICIAL: This is the official version of the Tor onion routing service for Android.***We Love Feedback***\u2605 ABOUT US: Guardian Project is a group of developers that make secure mobile apps and open-source code for a better tomorrow.\u2605 OPEN-SOURCE: Orbot is free software.

You can alternatively play the game directly on http://secretrepublic.comThe entirety of this story is not one to be told over a quiet dinner and a glass of wine.A tale about one individual who grasped the whole of humanity with his own two hands and played with it as with plasticine, bending civilisation to his own will.A genius? Perhaps. A madman? Surely. A human? That is for you to decide, really.Without the fear of our enemies, our bravery is meaningless.Today's hackers are the only ones able to express opinions, hacktivism being their only weapon.Emilia and the Cardinal are Artificial Intelligence entities that hold power over the entire Grid and AlphaCo assets.A competition has begun. A fight for the chairman position of Alpha, put at stake by the corporation itself.One of the many ways to earn Cash is by completing missions successfully.One other productive task would be taking on a job as often as possible.Most enjoyable is attacking hackers directly through the Grid or by taking part in Organization and Zone wars.You need to buy (CHEAP) server components and software to build your first MAIN server.Missions are means for you to gain experience, skills, money, achievements and notoriety.Mission groups become available as you fulfil their requirements. Selected few missions are available only in party and some can be redone daily rewarding you each time while others can be repeated unlimitedly with no rewards.You will be exposed to an UNIX-ish terminal, learning commands that you can even use outside of this world.Skills are used when spying, attacking, doing missions and generally interacting with the world.As you level up, complete missions, refer hackers, work, fight (and other) you gain Universal Skills Points (alias USP) which you can use to upgrade your skills.Abilities improve your skills. Access to new abilities will be gained as you progress on your path to becoming the single most powerful hacker out there.The Cardinal Mainframe limits how many servers you can own by your level and other factors.You will need components (which can be damaged) and software to run a server.Each app contributes to the server's skill levels and the skill levels of your Main come on top of your own in Missions. Non-main servers will be available to bounce and DDOS through in missions.Moreover, servers help you Mine for Data Points.If one were to give a short description of the Data Coins or Data Points, one could resume to the building blocks of the Grid.Companies around the glove and even Alpha themselves have adopted this system thanks to earlier successful pre-World War III implementations.Some of you might remember the controversial Bit Coin decentralised virtual currency which has slowly but steadily increased its value to rival real monetary markets through its independent nature.You can uncover relative data about your enemies' skills, servers && life on the Grid. Your skills contribute to your Spying capabilities just like they do for layers.Through attacks you can weaken, destroy and ultimately gain money and power.An ingame battle simulator is available for your to try and predict the outcome of Grid battles.The Grid is a huge cluster of nodes encompassing all zones and competitors.By scanning the grid, one can find allies and deal with enemies, tie friendships or destroy alliances.The forums are, simply put, the place to be. Private forums are available for Organizations.Organization wars make the difference between the strong.. and the weak.And this... this is just the beginning.Join our world,Without you, OUR bravery is meaningless,http://secretrepublic.net\nSecret Republic ~ Hacking ORPG for Android official Trailer\n\n\n\n"},

A website nominally associated with the group describes it as \"an Internet gathering\" with \"a very loose and decentralized command structure that operates on ideas rather than directives\". The group became known for a series of well-publicized publicity stunts and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on government, religious, and corporate websites. Anonymous originated in 2003 on the imageboard 4chan, representing the concept of many online and offline community users simultaneously existing as an anarchic, digitized global brain. Anonymous members (known as \"Anons\") can be distinguished in public by the wearing of Guy Fawkes masks in the style portrayed in the graphic novel and film V for Vendetta.In its early form, the concept was adopted by a decentralized online community acting anonymously in a coordinated manner, usually toward a loosely self-agreed goal, and primarily focused on entertainment, or \"lulz\". Beginning with 2008's Project Chanology\u2014a series of protests, pranks, and hacks targeting the Church of Scientology\u2014the Anonymous collective became increasingly associated with collaborative hacktivism on a number of issues internationally. Individuals claiming to align themselves with Anonymous undertook protests and other actions (including direct action) in retaliation against copyright-focused campaigns by motion picture and recording industry trade associations. Later targets of Anonymous hacktivism included government agencies of the U.S., Israel, Tunisia, Uganda, and others; the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant; child pornography sites; copyright protection agencies; the Westboro Baptist Church; and corporations such as PayPal, MasterCard, Visa, and Sony. Anons have publicly supported WikiLeaks and the Occupy movement.Beautiful Anonymous Wallpaper is 100% free application that help you save or download Beautiful Anonymous Wallpapers to your mobile.

This is an Unofficial Guide Zelda Breath of the Wild.In this app, you can follow this bellow :* Guide Zelda Breath of the Wild strategies to be win on game* Guide Zelda Breath of the Wild tips to be use on game* Guide Zelda Breath of the Wild tricks guide.The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has received almost nothing but praise. It became one of the best-reviewed games of all time, and was numbered as one of the five games to have the Metacritic score of 98\u2026 until Jim Sterling came along.  The latest installment of The Legend of Zelda dipped to 97, and some of the game\u2019s ardent fans think Jim\u2019s 7/10 review is responsible. According to the Metacritic blurb: \u201cAt its absolute best, Breath of the Wild offers some of the most absorbing experiences a Zelda game ever has. Unfortunately, it makes you work harder for it than you should, buried as it is under a pile of small but constant irritations that collaborate to form a thick crust of frustration around a delectable center. Breath of the Wild is a delightful adventure, one that tries its utmost to be as big a pain in the arse as possible.\u201dWhile hardly scathing, the review score was significantly lower and the tone much less full of praise than some fans expected. Apparently, the review was the cause of the latest DDoS attack on Jimquisition. Some gamers can\u2019t seem to let negative reviews of their favorite games stand. People love their timelines, there\u2019s no two ways about it. We like to classify things, especially when they are seemingly connected. Zelda\u2019s timeline has been pretty weird for a long time now, and it would appear that Breath of the Wild will only add to the confusion.Since the game has been out for a few days now, this means that many of the previous theories have been put to the test. The main issue seems to be that the game itself freely borrows elements and names from earlier games in a seemingly unconnected way. For example, the Koroks are there, the happy tree-planters from Wind Waker. Are they just a Zelda thing now or are they pointing to the fact that this Zelda fits after Wind Waker in the timeline? Do we count Amiibos in? Because the Wolf Link from Twilight Princess is technically in BotW if you have the right AmiiboEiji Aonuma, Zelda producer, has not helped keep things any clearer by doing interviews in Ocarina of Time T-shirt, as well as stating that Link has been asleep for a 100 years at the beginning of the game. This would definitely mean that this Link is from one of the previous games, which still limits it to some 16 games plus spin-offs! And for the first time we have DLCs coming as well.Notice:Any diversion name, images, characters, logo and different points of interest are not made by us, but facts by their individual owners.

Works with all applications! Easy to use software! Now You can freely visit ALL SITES in any part of the world. Securely encrypt your internet connection and protect your online identity!The main advantages of this technology:- VPN (IPSEC VPN and OpenVPN)- Cloud VPN (Personal server, UDP protocol)- VPN+TOR - You can select VPN location now.- Access to any restricted website.- Full tracking and interception protection.- Full local network attack protection.- Presence of the Firewall, that prevents the scanning of your IP address by Internet intruders.- Open Internet access despite all the local or state restrictions.- Wi-Fi network scan and data acquisition protection.- Full access to all VOIP carriers including Skype.- Completely anonymous Internet access.What is a VPN?A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a clever piece of technology that gives you the choice from being an ordinary Internet user \u2013 to being an Internet VIP. It\u2019s like having a golden ticket for the Internet - it will let you bypass censorship, unblock content and protects your privacy and security whilst you\u2019re online.Why do you need a VPN? Anytime you use a public internet service you are putting your security and privacy at risk. Personal data can easily be misused and stolen in cafes, hotels, airports and other free Wi-Fi hotspots. Globus Free Pro VPN offers you government-level protection and peace of mind for your personal data whenever you surf the internet \u2013 wherever you are.Globus VPN/TOR Free Pro  has the added benefit of allowing you to unblock favourite websites, services and content by switching country. With Globus VPN/TOR you can ensure that you\u2019ll enjoy all your favourite internet services and sites, no matter where you are.Globus VPN + TOR\u2026This is a perfect security solution when users can route Tor through VPN services which will prevent your ISP from seeing that you're using Tor. On one hand, VPNs are more popular than Tor, so you won't stand out as much but on the other hand, in some countries replacing an encrypted Tor connection with an encrypted VPN connection, would be suspicious as well but not with Globus VPN where one can select a specific server in a specific country of your choice. Once the VPN client has connected, the VPN tunnel will be the machine's default Internet connection, and TBB (Tor Browser Bundle) (or Tor client) will route through it.Another advantage here is that this prevents Tor from seeing who you are behind the Globus VPN. So if somebody somehow does manage to break Tor and learn the IP address your traffic is coming from, but your VPN was actually following through on their premises (they won't watch, they won't remember, and they will somehow magically make it so nobody else is watching either), then you'll be better off. But this will not happen. VPN BROWSER FOR PC IN OUR SITE: Anonymously encrypt all traffic! Works with all applications! Easy to use software!

Promise!)\u2022\u2003Optionally auto-downloads the individual RSS entry weekly instead of wasteful daily scan (That efficency! Do check out the available modes when setting up an entry).\u2022\u2003 Being lightweight. Very, lightweight. The full Java code is only 169 kB uncompressed while the rest is populated by the Material resources.\u2022\u2003 A pleasant Dark Material Design theme for our precious eyesUpcoming features:\u2022\u2003 Importing/Exporting watchlist (backup and maybe for giggles)\u2022\u2003 Factory Mode for creating entry from media files (with original names) located on the device. Should be very useful during the early season crunch.This is initially intended as an RSS reader for dedicated low power machine like the Raspberry Pi, mini android box, and the niches, so it might shy away from a full fledged RSS reader. But for what it does, it does really well. Minus that recent 14.5 episode recap, so far parsed entries from major groups have 100% match rate.While some parts may not be fully Material Design yet (coming soon!), the current design is my humble interpretation of the new design docs. Comments and feedback are very much welcomed.LEGAL DISCLAIMER:  This app DOES NOT and WILL NOT download any of the files linked in the torrent files. It can only optionally downloads a generic metadata file (e.g. a .torrent metafile) from a feed like any RSS readers out there. PERMISSION DETAILSACCESS_NETWORK_STATE:  Used for WiFi-only option to determine whether it is allowed to use the current connection.INTERNET:  For refreshing feeds and creation of new entries.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE :  To save the feed contents (optional). Post-KitKat users please be aware of Google&apos;s new mandatory changes for KitKat and forward. Simply put, apps are now limited to only peruse certain directories on the external SD card unless rooted. While any folder in the device internal SD card works fine, any Public directory like Downloads on the external SD may or may not be usable depending on the manufacturer.

The combination of components and wires allows various simple and complex operations to be performed: signals can be amplified, computations can be performed, and data can be moved from one place to anotherCircuits can be constructed of discrete components connected by individual pieces of wire, but today it is much more common to create interconnections by photolithographic techniques on a laminated substrate (a printed circuit board or PCB) and solder the components to these interconnections to create a finished circuit. In an integrated circuit or IC, the components and interconnections are formed on the same substrate, typically a semiconductor such as silicon or (less commonly) gallium arsenide.An electronic circuit can usually be categorized as an analog circuit, a digital circuit, or a mixed-signal circuit (a combination of analog circuits and digital circuits).Introductory Circuit Tuts is best for all student of Computer science, electronics and electrical engineering Introductory Circuit Tuts contain all essential basic, intermediate and advance topics of CircuitsIntroductory Circuit best pocket guide for Android usersIntroductory Circuit contains following topicsAtoms and Their Structure Resistance Ohm's Law, Fowet and Energy Series CircuitAtoms and Their Structure:  Current Voltage Fixed AC/DC Supply Conductors anC Insulators Semiconductors Ammeters and VoltmetersIntroduction of Resistance:  Resistance: Circular Wires Resistance: Metric Units The Effect of Temperature Superconduct  Types of Resistor Color Coding and Standard Resistor Values Conductance Ohmmeter Thermistors Photoconductive Cell Varistors Mathcad Ohm's Law Plotting Ohm's Law Power Wattmeter Energy Circuit breakers gfci and fuses Computer AnalysisIntroduction to Series Circuit:  Series Circuit Voltage source in series kirchhoff's voltage law Interchanging series elements Voltage Driver Rule Notation Internal Resistance of Voltage Sources****************************APP FEATURES****************************Still looking for reasons why the \u201cIntroductory Circuit Tuts\u201d app is unique among all other apps in the market.
